0,1,"Slippery? then it must be a sluagh: If i had to choose a book out of the ones I've read abut Changeling, I'd choose this one. Why? It's simple: the information is not only interesting but also very ample. Before I read this book I tought that sluaghs were just ugly, smelly and disgusting faeries. Who wants to play a character that cannot raise its voice above a whisper? Now, I'm grateful I overcame my prejudices: sluaghs are far more than that. Useful for those who love secrecy, and mystery, and the darker side of the Dreaming."
1,1,"A lesson: I believe that this book should be read along with the Fall, for as Camus intended, the two works lend insight into each other. I don't believe it's quite accurate to boil these stroies down into existential philosophy and social crticism. There is something to Camus' work which speaks to more hidden aspirations. This is an incredible collection of stories, who's diversity defies Hemingway. However, unlike the other reviews, I don't believe that the stories are about exile in such a simple way. Many of the charcters seem to be liberated at the end of their stories...or, imprisoned. Either way, the exile involved here, I think, may have more to do with the kingdom of God. Take that as you will. This is a strong piece of literature."
2,1,"Little Kids CAN Do This - also a note about how this is related to a Montessori activity: My 4 1/2 year old daughter received a Crayola Cutter for Christmas and she LOVES it. Yes, you have to move the pen slowly and hold it straight up and down, but I explained that to her before she got started and neither issue seems to deter her from cutting and enjoying it.However, her patience may be the result of her experience with an activity at her Montessori school. They do 'push pinning', where the children manually perforate construction paper to cut out shapes. Compared to that tedious activity, this is a breeze. So if your child has attended a Montessori program and done push pinning, he/she will probably love this."
3,1,"Not Dangerous: I don't know why people keep saying this thing is dangerous just because of what it looks like. People are equating it to a tattoo needle! Anyways, it's NOT dangerous, I've heard of many adults actually turning it on on their own hand to make sure it's safe and IT IS. I've never heard of someone (or their kids) getting cut with this thing. Crayola would be pretty dumb to market this thing as safe if it wasn't. That would be a lawsuit waiting to happen and they know it.In any case, I personally think this cutter is pretty neat and is a blast for all kinds of projects. If someone buys it and it doesn't work all that well, just return it and be done with it, yanno? And of course if you love it, well, keep it and have fun!"
4,1,great dvds: i have copied many movies with these dvds. the quality of the copies are amazing.i would recommend these dvds to everyone.
5,1,"Awesome, healthy cracker: I think these crackers are wonderful!! I love the individual packages as they are great for on-the-go and portion control. I am a personal trainer and recommend these to everyone. They are high in fiber, low in carbs, and have a wonderful flavor. The bonus is they are organic & don't contain processed foods...all whole grains & essential fatty acids. What more could you ask for!!"
6,1,"Most Useful Dictionary: I have a 1971 copy of this dictionary which I am still using. Why? It is compact, the size of a typical short paperback novel, but it has more entries then many of the very big, but not easily handled dictionaries. The author just uses very brief definitions which most of the time is all I need. The result is that I have consistently used this dictionary since 1971 leaving the big dictionaries on the shelf."
7,1,"A Good Intro to Rushdie: I really enjoyed this collection of stories, and think that the book is a good introduction to Rushdie. I think my favorites in the collection were ""The Prophet\'s Hair,"" and ""The Courter."" In fact, I think ""The Prophet\'s Hair,"" was the story which truly reminded me that Rushdie knows how to turn a phrase. While at times there is a certain ambivalence in some stories, I think that is understandable in point of view of Rushdie\'s own background. It is an attitude that comes from being a product of two cultures and wanting to have claims to both, not just one or the other, as Rushdie so elegantly proclaims at the end of ""The Courter.&quot"
8,1,"--Nine Rushdie tales. =East, West, East/West.: Rushdie\'s writing contains the joyous confusions of being claimed by two cultures. I love when Rushdie digresses a bit and lets loose a curious flood of details, such as when describing a case of noxious bad"
9,1,"New to US crochet: This is a beautiful book, designs by Patricia Kristoffersen, so no further explanation needed. The doilies look a little daunting to start with, especially if you are not used to US patterns or raised/twisted stitches, but with such brilliant instructions, and pictures to help, it's near impossible to go wrong. It's probably not for the faint-hearted or beginners, but if you love to crochet as much as I do, your own knowledge of what stitches and sequences of stiches should look like, will help you enormously. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a challenge and loves beautiful designs."
10,1,"Printable, but no PDF: This document is 27 pages, and is a reprint of a journal article with hypertext links. It is shown as a webpage, which you can print but not save. There is no PDF involved."
11,1,"BEWARE!: I agree with RedTunicTroll\'s review - I\'ve waited a long time to see this great album re-issued on CD (hence the five star rating). I would add that the remastering is excellent. However, I am very sorry to say that Varese (the re-issue label) has substituted an alternate demo take of ""Country Boy"" instead of the full band version that appears on the original album. The version of ""Country Boy"" on this CD has just Cash with his guitar. It\'s a nice version of the song, but the one on the original album has Perkins on guitar and Grant on bass. I know this for certain because I have an original copy of this album from the late 1950s - it\'s a very beat-up copy, but it plays well enough for me to say without a doubt that Varese made a mistake!"
12,1,"She's so sweet: Drew Barrymore is a doll in this short story comedy about a southern gal finding a father of her child. At first, I thought it was a comeback of the movie, Annie at the first glimpse of Sally at the burger drive in. I just love her charms besides her glossy lips. Although funny, the only criticism that sparks in this comedy is that Sally, who is so young and innocent and who got pregnated by an overwhelmingly older man should deliver a message to young girls to be responsible on their bodies. This is rated PG, so I would strongly urge parents out there to render advice. That's all folks, otherwise, it is a great comedy for the entire family to watch."
13,1,"Ridiculous and funny dark comedy: This movie has enough plot twists and comic relief to keep anyone's attention. Loved Drew Barrymore. I found myself getting pulled in by the drama, only to laugh outloud. A fun relief from reality. That is what movies are for, aren't they?"
14,1,"a great ""why not?"" movie: i went to this movie intending to be disgusted because it looked like one of those ""romantic comedies"" all the girls are so fond of these days. but i had a free movie pass about to expire and i figured ""why not?"". it turned out to be more insane then romantic! which i thought was cool, because...you know....insanity is always good."
15,1,"Sweet, funny movie: I just love this movie. Drew Barrymore plays the charachter of Sally,who is really likeable and sweet.You can\'t help but fall in love with ""Sally\'s"" gentle, sensitive personality and the fact that she always trys to be the best person that she can be. Luke Wilson, who is one of the best looking men on the planet, portrays Dorian, an equally kind and lovable character who has to deal with a crazy mother & brother, while falling in love with Sally. ""Home Fries"" is a great movie about getting over the hurdles of life and fighting to be with the one you love."
16,1,"Wild,Weird: Home Fries is an endearing dark comedy. The movie is filled with wild, weird twists and turns revolving around the death of a cheating step-father.The movie is flat out,laugh out loud funny. There is also a completely charming romance between one of the step-sons and the pregnant girlfriend of the step-dad.Drew Barrymore is radiant as the girlfriend and Luke Wilson is perfect as her messed up suitor.Add Catherine O'Hara as the crazy Mom and Jake Busey as the going crazy brother-and you have a don't miss movie!"
17,1,"Wow. . . . . . .: It was weird! Half the people acted crazy, especially Luke Wilson's brother and Mama! Besides they both killed their stepfather can you believe it? Drew Barrymore this was not your best at all, but their were still some sad and funny, and of course cute parts, so most people (if you like Drew Barrymore, like me) would like it okay. K!"
18,1,"An excellect production: The first thing I wanted to do after watching this captivating story was to read the book. Usually, I like the book better than the movie but, in this instance, the movie is true to the book and the actors so brilliantly cast that the two complement each other. In particular, the movie was stunningly photographed in England, Italy and elsewhere. The story is powerful and tragic. I heartily recommend both the video and the book."
19,1,"Charmingly moving: Starting with the silky narrative by Jeremy Irons, this series will elevate you, educate you, and most certainly entertain you. I can't think of a better adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's book that this marvelous BBC rendition. The scenery, the costumes and, above all, the intoxicatingly vivid relationships will delight you. The bit parts by Sir John Gielgud and Sir Lawrence Olivier are not to be missed."
20,1,Television drama doesn't get any better than this ! Superb!: If you watch this series and don't come away affected by it then you must be dead ! Andrwews is divine as Sebastian ! THE best drama of all time without doubt !
21,1,"Spiritual Journey: This is a film you don't realize how much you like until its over. Sounds strange-but in many ways this is a strange film. Not strange bad, but unlike anything you may have seen. I didn't realize what the film was REALLY about until the end. Its about one man's spiritual journey and his quest to find his place in life,to find love, but mostly about his quest to find meaning in religion. But the religious theme is quite subtle. At first it just seems like a drawn-out story about a lonely homosexual boy and frankly I was bored with it for a while. But I can highly recommend it, I don't beleive I have seen many films that deal with a person's quest for a meaningful religious belief quite like this one. It is not an upbeat story. But the acting is top-notch. Jeremy Irons is perfect in his role. Don't think his character is just a doe doe with nothing to say. He is quiet and introspective and seeking truth."
22,1,"DVD Set of Brideshead Revisited: This is a deluxe set of four DVD discs contained in a white glossy box with a picture of two of the central movie characters on the box. The movie ""Brideshead Revisited"",based on Evelyn Waugh\'s 1945 novel was originally made by the BBC between 1979-1981 for television and is one of the best things they have ever done. The movie is in eleven episodes and totals eleven hours of viewing.As I saw the original on television, I can attest to the fact that the color and sound of the movie is as good as was the original film. I also have visited Castle Howard, the site of Brideshead. The estate is one of the main characters in the film and has been depicted in wonderful camera shots and color. I can highly recommend this DVD.Robert"
23,1,"Brideshead Revisited 25th Annaversery: I enjoyed this program on PBS many years ago. Seeing it again, it was even better than I remembered."
24,1,"Amazingly Wonderful Video: The 1981 BBC presentation of Brideshead Revisited is amazingly lush, authentic and powerful. It gives one a view into extremely privileged lives in a different time and place and shows that being rich does not solve all of life's complex problems. Watching it is a commitment, as it takes 11-hours of viewing time, but it's time well spent."
25,1,"The Rumors Are True - This is Amazing!: Imagine how I felt when I found out that my favorite novel, Brideshead Revisited, was made into a first-class TV mini-series with almost 14 hours of footage. I read the Amazon reviews and decided that they were good enough for me to spend the exorbinant amount to buy it. It was worth it! This collection of DVD's is almost word-for-word faithful to Waugh's masterpiece and brings it alive beautifully. I've watched it like ten zillion times. Highly recommended!God bless those weird Brit's!"
26,1,"Bridehead Revisited Review: After seeing the movie of Brideshead Revisited, my only conclusion can be that 4 CD set of Bridehead is far superior than the recent movie production. Having seen this production 25 years ago, made me realize just how great it really was and very much ahead of it's time. I recommend this CD set to everyone who enjoys superior acting and real art.It was absolutely brilliant and historic."
27,1,"The greatest television series beautifully remastered on DVD: This is the greatest series ever produced for television. This special anniversary edition is beautifully remastered and full of informative extras.It is a treat to see legends like Laurence Olivier and John Geilgud performing in great roles along-side a young Jeremy Irons, just starting his career."
28,1,"Great series: This purchase was made to replace the VHS version I made from cable twenty years ago.It offers all I was looking for, i.e. a great series on a friendlier format."
29,1,A Beautiful masterpiece: I would have to give each episode 5 stars. This is a beautiful masterpiece. The acting is superb especially by Andrews and Irons. The production is one of a kind. I enjoyed this miniseries from start to finish. Granted there are parts that drag but it is still magnificent to look at. I am now going to read the book and hopefully the 2008 version will come to my town so I can see it.
30,1,"Favorite PBS series: This is my all time favorite PBS series. I saw it years ago when it was first on TV and for some reason thought of it again recently and ordered it. It was better than I remembered. As I tell my friends I have loaned it to, you have to pay attention to get the full impact. You can't watch it and read a magazine at the same time. Well worth the effort."
31,1,If only all TV were this good: Amazon is making me review this version although I haven't had time to watch it yet. But I already own the previous DVD and have watched it many times. I consider 'Brideshead' to be Prozac for the soul.
32,1,"Fabulous Series: I am not one for noticing technological fine points so I will not comment on the less than technically perfect DVD. However, I do love excellent writing and acting and John Mortimer's adaptation of the Evelyn Waugh novel is simply superb. It is what brought Jeremy Irons to the attention of American audiences. He is the narrator of this story about a very wealthy Catholic English family. He is drawn into this family when he meets the son, Sebastian, at his college. Eventually, he is drawn into relationships with more family members and Sebastian's sisters, Julia and Cordelia, also become very important to him. Sebastian is ultimately a flawed and trajic man whereas our narrator begins to adopt the worst aspects of the upper class into his own character: boredom, lassitude, disenchantment and jadedness. Set in the earlier 20th century, the recreation of detail period and costume is also outstanding."
33,1,"Excellent DVD Collector's Set!: Finally! This television masterpiece has come to DVD in a nicely packaged and digitally remastered presentation. I'm not sure what the problem was with Mr. Stewart's player, but the discs all play beautifully on the several players I've tried them in. And the color restoration and remastering provides the clearest and best picture I've ever seen. Based on Evelyn Waugh's classic novel, Brideshead is an elegant and unforgettable story set in the fading years of the British Empire and stars Jeremy Irons and Anthony Edwards in career-making roles. I'm a little disappointed not to see an interview with Irons on the DVD, but the *real* reason to buy this is for the series itself. It's well worth revisiting, again and again."
34,1,"His Chicago is better...: I like very much Abbado directing Mahler's 7th. The velvety sound of this recording makes adds to the impression of night indeed, and I could of course have rated this one with the five stars, but the velvety sound can also be described as haze, it is not clear, and this aspect it shares with the Abbado/Berlin 9th and 6th.Abbado's earlier recording of the 7th with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra - amazon-search: B000001GNE - feels much deeper and urgent to me, more inspired. Chicago played as good as, if not better, the Berlins, and most important: the recorded sound is clearer. I got this Abbado/Berlin before I purchased the Chicago, so this is not a matter of habit. I have many great Mahler 7th, Kubelik (DGG), Kondrashin, Bernstein (Sony), Gielen and these two by Abbado - I don't mention the not so great. My deserted island pick for this symphony would be either Bernstein/New York (Sony) or Abbado/Chicago (DGG), in spite of the superior clarity of Gielen's 7th."
35,1,A great new way of thinking!: This book will give you a functional view of what knowledge management is and how to implement its processes in your company or organization. It's written very well and not a boring read. It has a lot of interesting new ways to think about how to change corporate or organizational culture in order to effectively compete in a global business climate. This book can be useful for people that work in a business with four employees or a business with thousands.
36,1,"Novel use: I actually bought this red lens to convert a bright white bike headlight into a tail light for my wife. You can't really get super bright tail lights but this lens helped me sort of invent a new product that my wife uses when she rides at night and she loves it. The quality is very high, the plastic is tough, you can bend it more than in half and it doesn't crack. The finish and circularity are all top quality, too."
37,1,"Works Great: Works great on melamine edge banding. Trimmed flush right out of the package, but took a little adjustment to get a slight bevel. Once the bevel is adjusted, the edge feels very smooth and will not be likely to snag."
38,1,"Do yourself a favor: Listen to the samples. Like what you hear? Good.Please buy the CD.Turn off your cell phone and listen to this disc on a decentstereo system.Aren't these guys great? Hear that bass sax? Are you smiling?Good! Spread the word.(p.s. In keeping with the style of music presented here,Dick Hyman's playing is pretty mellow-any of his solo recordings will make your jaw drop.)"
39,1,"Best Tweezers ever!: I never really thought much one way or the other about tweezers, but after hearing good things about Tweezerman, I thought I'd splurge. They work so well! They effortlessly pick up hairs you can barely see, and since it grasps the hairs well, it doesn't hurt as much as cheaper tweezers."
40,1,"Mexican master muralist: Gallery catalog from an exhibit at the Plaza de la Raza in Los Angeles, which includes letters of praise from Mayor Bradley, and intense brilliant color and black & white photos of the muralist Siqueiros. Warning: some of these art images are very violent and graphic, like european paintings of war! Excellent text in both English and Spanish to give us insight. 64 pgs."
41,1,"A must have for any serious student of astrology: There are plenty of books out there that will tell you what your Sun sign means. There are some books that will describe certain aspects, such as Sun square Mars (like the excellent James Braha title.)Tierney's book, however, is one of the few (if not the only one) that will explain in depth what an aspect itself (e.g. a sextile, a square, an inconjunct) means, how waxing and waning aspects are different, how aspects relate to signs and the more complex configurations that build on aspects, as well as other topics such as retrogrades.While the material is rather abstract, in my opinion it is virtually impossible to have a mastery of astrology without understanding the contents of this volume. It is that profound and important."
42,1,"Truly Awesome: I have been a Yes fan for about 30 years and I must say this is one of the best pieces of music I've heard. With today's technology, everything is so crisp and very refined. This is one box set every true yes fan should own. It may be a little pricey to some, but I must say....it's well worth the money.The book that comes with the five c.d. set just adds to the flavor. Having been seperated from Yes music for a while, when my fiancee gave this to me as a Christmas gift I was very pleased. Once I heard it....well let me say this, it actually brought tears to my eyes,as well as a lot of memories. This is a must have for the true Yes fan. I got the fever and found websites of all the members and the website of Yes World. Yes fans.....you have got to get this."
43,1,"A great romantic read!: Chance of a Lifetime is Amy's Leigh's first novel, and what a treat it is! It's humorous, heartwarming, and the characters practically leap off the page they're so real-to-life. Ms. Leigh does an excellent job of creating regional flavor and dialogue, and the ending sent me rushing for my hankie. This is definitely a romance author you'll want to keep an eye on!"
44,1,"Two words: It's AWESOME: This CD is great, and I can't wait until they come out with another. They all are great looking and have great voices. So I can't rate them by those two factors. All in all you Guys ROCK!"
45,1,Awesome!: The product arrived very quick and in great packaging. Thank you! Just started using the product and I'm loving it so far. I was very happy to find it on amazon!
46,1,Gathering Friends books: These girls know how to write patterns for busy quilters. I have every one of their books. Keep them coming girls !!
47,1,"New history for an older Texan!: I am a native Texan and history buff, but I was never aware of the important role many small Texas towns played in the aerial war efforts of the United States. What a revelation this book provided.Very well written, interesting, informative, humorous and sometimes tragic, The Stars Were Big and Bright is one book that will remain in my personal library for years to come. It is sure to be reread whenever the urge to revisit the history of Texas' contribution to the U.S. Army Air Force's efforts during WWI and WWII.I was impressed also with the numerous vintage photograps, maps, descriptions of the relevant airfields, aircraft photos and specifications, as well as the high level of documentation from primary source documents.This book absolutely has to be the best book on this topic yet written. Perhaps the author, Thomas E. Alexander, will treat us to another great book in the future."
48,1,Wow--What a Fascinating Book: I thoroughly enjoyed the portrayal of the life and times of Sweetwater as well as what it was like to be a WASP in a small Texas town!
49,1,"Historian Decribes Role Air Stations Have Played in Texas: ""Aviation buffs and fans of 20th-century Texas history will find plenty to please them in this well-written and often entertaining work."""
50,1,Unavoidable: Can any-one like Mahler and not fall under the magic of Abado. The stunning combination of a great conductor and an iconic orchestra the Berliner Philharmoniker.
51,1,"""It seems I\'m some kind of Galactic yo-yo!"": An unidentified flying object has landed near the Nuton power complex, supplying Britian with safe, cheap energy. The Axons, aliens form the ""far side of the galaxy"", intend to suck the Earth dry of all its energies and leave nothing behind. A good UNIT story. Lots of action, people blowing up, and some of Who\'s most disgusting lookin aliens. Pertwee and the regulars are great, although Fyler\'s accent is a little iffy. And why, in a majority of Pertwee stories, when a person is in hospital or sedated, they start to wail on about stopping the Master(see the Daemons)? The story itself might be a little silly for casual viewers, but all in all, a great action-packed psychedelic Who Adventure!"
52,1,Lo lei en español y me parecio muy logrado: Es un libro muy bien escrito y muy respetuoso. Diria que es una investigación muy original de la obra de Borges y que estimula la lectura de Borges No se si se publicara esto porque no esta en ingles.Pero quiero expresar mi admiración por este libro.
53,1,"Worked for me: I had tried many times to quit smoking. But this was the book that guided me through the process successfully in 1974. I have been nicotine free since then.The most helpful thing I can remember was learning that my own mind was my worst enemy. It seems that my mind had a 'mind' of its own. My mind would wait till I was depressed or craving a cigarette, then it would parade every happy loving moment in my life (only the moments where a cigarette was involved) and tell me that I could go back to that good life if I would only just start smoking again.But thanks to this book, I was prepared!It's a fast read, very short, to the point, and full of useful tips that helped me quit.The addiction to cigarettes is like no other addiction....it is war and you had better be prepared if you want to win.This book will help."
54,1,"Wonderful!: I got all three (original movies) of these posters for my boyfriend for Christmas, we're both huge fans! They're just like the original movie posters from hanging in theaters and they have the release dates on them and everything! I got the EZ hang framing option and its worth it, they hardly curl so it's amazingly easy to frame them with simple affordable poster frames I also got on amazon searching by their exact dimensions. He was ecstatic about them and I love them too!"
55,1,#4 on my top 10 horror list: This movie was really good but it'll make you check your forehead a lot! See the movie and you'll know what I mean!
56,1,"Including a wealth of gorgeous color photographs: Navajo Ceremonial Baskets: Sacred Symbols Sacred Space explores the importance of the cerimonial basket in Navajo culture. Including a wealth of gorgeous color photographs throughout, portraits of award-winning basket weavers and their creations, involved interviews with Navajo medicine men, enjoyable tales of legendary heroic figures who played a role in the origin of baskets, straightforward information from everything concerning etiquette and safekeeping of ceremonial baskets to techniques for making tight-sealing woven water jars, and much more, Navajo Ceremonial Baskets is a welcome, informative, and enjoyable addition to Native American culture collections."
57,1,"Treasure Maps are Fun.: Martha Grimes follows up her MAN WITH A LOAD OF MISCHIEF with THE ANODYNE NECKLACE. A story of murder, missing jewels, new interests, delightful off-beat characters and an unforgetable tour of London's East Side.Richard Jury is investigating a murder, but Lady Jenny Kennington is a lady with real problems. My favorite character was Mrs. Pennystevens who never beamed Sir Miles as I would have like to have done. I know I've met Ernestine Craigie, finder of bodies & bird watcher, on the streets of several small towns.Good read--enjoy.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
58,1,"Great little product: This thing does what it says it does, has three cutting attachments to hit any angle you need, and nearly zero instructions to confuse the heck out of you. Very, very straightforward and easy to use product. If you are looking to spend very little money for very good value, this is a product worth your time and cash."
59,1,"Powerful thinking: Common Interest, Common Good represents powerful thinking that has already withstood many challenges and overcome many barriers. Corporate executives will benefit greatly from the book's clear and cogent lessons on the benefits of corporate/social sector partnership. This book is proof that goodness can endure."
60,1,"Yes!! Finally Breast Cancer prevention. Women need this!!: I have been overwhelmed with statistics regarding my chances of getting breast cancer and I had not found any good sources until this book, which (a) demystifies the myths that one can't prevent BC when they can (b) offesr a realistic strategy to fight this scary disease (c) IS written in simple english!! READ IT!!!I PROMISE YOU THAT IF YOU WANT TO ARM YOURSELF AGAINST THIS DISEASE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS BOOK FOR YOURSELF AS WELL AS THE OTHER WOMEN IN YOUR LIFE. WE MUST FIGHT THIS DISEASE AND IN DOING SO WE MUST EDUCATE OURSELVES WHICH THIS BOOK GIVES US THE POWER TO DO!"
61,1,"A MUST READ FOR WOMEN WHO WANT TO ACTIVELY PREVENT BC !!!: I have read every Breast Cancer book on the market. The Truth About Breast Cancer finally offers women the necessary education for us to make informed decisions about negotiating our way through a very difficult issue. The book is written in a professional voice which teaches how breast cancer may be prevented as oppossed to so many other books which simply raddle off scary statistics as well as trendy diets. Please, if you want to arm yourself with vital information and desire a campassionatly written and thoroughly researched book written for WOMEN and not doctors, read The Truth About Breast Cancer."
62,1,"Every woman should buy this book!: Ever since my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer I have read almost anything I can get my hands on regarding this dreadful disease. This book is by far the most outstanding I have read. I wish I had looked here first. Joseph Keon's 7-step plan is remarkable and so very easy to read. I've read it from cover to cover 3 or 4 times and have tried almost all of the recipes he suggests. They are just fantastic. I've watched my weight and exercised regularly most of my life....now I feel that, with his help, I'm on the right track with nutrition, too. If only we all would follow his advice, maybe there would be less people having to deal with breast cancer. I highly recommend reading this book."
63,1,Keon's book is very comprehensive.: The Truth About Breast Cancer is a thorough book about overall health in general and very in depth regarding Breast Cancer prevention. It will be a valuable assest in everybody's library - whether for yourself or as a gift. Keon details many facts and figures that will astonish most readers. The tone of this book is urgent yet not suffocating. The choice is yours to make - live a healthy life by following Keon's guidelines and his Revised American Diet. You will need to put this on an easily accessible shelf as you will be constantly using it for reference - the recipes in the back of the book are delicious!
64,1,A Book Everyone Should Have In Thier Library: My mom had breast cancer and Keons book really helped her understand the ways of preventing a re-occurance. The writing is very easily understood unlike several other books that requires one to almost have a medical background. I highly recommend this book to everyone that is in to preventive medicine.
65,1,"Preserved In Amber - When Music Could Be ""Fun"": Freddie was never Elvis, Buddy Holly or Chuck Berry, nor do I think he so intended. What he did was to make a series of radio-friendly fun records, a bit offbeat, over a very long period. Some try to dismiss him as a ""novelty"" record guy, but that\'s not true. This CD would be fun even if you were born in the 80\'s and have no idea who ""Boom-Boom"" even is. And if anybody questions his chops, play ""Tallahassee Lassie"" for them. Kenny Paulsen\'s guitar playing here is on the same edge of heavy metal as that in The Guess Who\'s version of Johnny Kidd\'s ""Shakin\' All Over"", but Kenny\'s a better player. He sounds a bit like Cliff Gallup, Gene Vincent\'s original guitar player, and that\'s high praise. His intro riff is a killer, and the cut just flashes brilliance! The whole CD just illustrates the fact that ""fun records"" could exist then but don\'t now - and there\'s nobody like the intense Freddy Cannon to do them, either!"
66,1,Freddy Cannon best of: Nice to see a good catalogue of Freddies hits after a long wait.I found the quality very good.
67,1,"BORU, BORU, BORU they chant!!!: The fire, the passion, the gentleness and the ferocity of this book is truly remarkable. It is a treat to the mind, one that develops the verdant landscape of those days, but yet gives hope for the future. If once a King such as Brian Boru could unite Ireland, then surely it can be done again. A man of his talents, finesse and courage will appear again and understand how history plays such an important role, and possibly take lessons from Brian's own life, superbly done by Morgan Llywelyn."
68,1,Master Piece: This is truly a work of art. This the best book on the middle ages and Ireland that I have ever read. I especially enjoyed the part when Brian and others lived in the woods and fought the Northmen guerilla style with hit and run tactics. Everyone who loves Ireland or the Middle ages should read this book and the best part about it is that it is just about all true!
69,1,"I loved it!!: It was a magnificent portrait of a real man, a delightful combination of myth, magic and humanity that made it clear how all Ireland fell under his spell."
70,1,"History that is truely better than fiction !: Brian Boru is the real-life character that fantasy characters only aspire to be. One cannot fight the desire to travel back in time and fight at Brian Boru's side during Ireland's golden age after reading this spectacular, marvelous book. William Wallace is a hack compared to Brian Boru !"
71,1,"A book that can change your life: I read this book (the first time, at least) when I was 15. I agree, some of the content may not be appropriate for adolescents. However, the message the book gave me has changed my life for the better. In Brian, I saw the power of dreaming big, of not forgetting and to never stop persuing your dreams. It opened my eyes and the world became a much more exciting, magical place - much like the wonderful places Llywelyn describes in her books. All of her books are moving, and often leave you shaken and begging for more - but this one contains so many powerful lessons wrapped up in an engrossing, epic, and mostly true story! If you havent read it yet, you are truly missing out."
72,1,"my review: I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a true historical novel, since I learned a lot about Irish history of the times, and also came to very much like Brian of Boruma and all that he felt and accomplished for his country.The characters are vey alive and real and all the facts presented, like wars, marriages are very well presented and not boring to read. The places as well as life in those ages are also very alive and easy to read and learn about.A very good book and a pleasure to read."
73,1,Lion of Ireland great story: This is a history of Ireland told in an adventurous manner. History can be so boring not this time. Thank you.
74,1,"Awesome book!: I loved the Lion of Ireland. I'm a huge fan of historical novels, but only when they are entertaining as well as factual. This one met all the requirements."
75,1,"I loved this book because itscharacters were brought to life: history and personble characters . . . a great combo I couln't put it down, I really like the way she writes"
76,1,"wow: I had read this book when i was only 13, although the content was a LITTLE too mature for me. I still loved it, I hadven\'t missed a year of not reading it at least once. ""Lion.."" has introduced me to the worlds Llywelyn paints and i have remained faithful to her since i was a kid. Ive read every book she has ever published (Good and bad ;) ). Ive recommended this book to everyone. Anyone, not only interested in Celtic or Irish history, but history in general would greatly appreciate this book. The people who gave it anything less than ""five stars"" must either dislike the Irish or have something against a good book!"
77,1,"good: I watched the movie, then I was thinking I should read ht ebook, so I get it with very reasonable price"
78,1,"Not to bad...: I actually enjoyed this book more than I thought I would after reading some reviews. It was slow at times, but I saw the movie first and the book I thought was better. There are some language issues, but I'm not turned off by that but I could see how some people might be."
79,1,"Laugh out-loud funny: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was drawn to read it based on the premise, which sounded like a riot. I wasn't disappointed. No, it didn't teach me how to prepare any of the recipes, but from reading the cover description, I didn't think it would. I would strongly recommend this book if you are intrigued by the idea of reading a light hearted memoir that revolves around food."
80,1,"Cute Book with More Detail than the Movie: I was in the middle of reading J&J then saw the movie version. Seeing the movie just made me all the more gung-ho to finish the book and of course, buy myself a copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking!! Outside of the scenes of Paris in the movie, the book has much more detail of life in NYC apres 9/11 and the arduousness of Julie's idea of a project -- to cook each recipe from the massive cookbook and blog about it. It's a fun read, and makes you feel fatter with all the buttery recipes. I recommend both book and movie!!"
81,1,"Insipiring: I didn't see the movie and do not plan to - I generally enjoy the book better. I love cooking and found this book inspirational - as in when attempting to do something one does not need a perfect outcome. There weren't a lot of English print books to choose from while I was vacationing in Italy but this was on the shelf. At ten euros it most definitely overpriced but I had only brought one novel that I too quickly finished. I think the book was a very enjoyable, light read."
82,1,"Julie and Julia: Julie Powell is in a rut; not enjoying her job anymore and feeling somewhat purposeless. On a trip back home to her parent's house, she finds a copy of Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking and comes up with a crazy idea. Over the course of one year, she is going to cook every recipe in the book and write a blog about it. This book is an extension of that blog and her experiences during the project.Julie is a humourous writer and does not glamourize her feelings, successes, and failures during the year of cooking. Some of the side stories about her friend's lives could have been shortened or left out, as I found myself losing interest in these parts. I would also have liked to read more about Julia Child as well, but overall, this is a fun read that really lets you get to know Julie....and way more about bone marrow and killing lobsters than you ever wanted to!"
83,1,"Enjoyable Read: I\'m really surprised by the scathing reviews that have been posted here. Some people seem to forget that Julia Child is not the author of this book. This is a book about Julie and the impact Julia had on her life. Read ""My Life in France"" if you only want to know about Julia Child.I\'m glad Julie was able to find solace and success in her cooking project while working at a stressful and thankless temp job. I thought this was a great memoir.The movie was a disappointment and didn\'t give Julie the depth of character that comes through in the novel."
84,1,"One woman's story - a quick, fun read: All of the 1 star people need to take a BREAK! This book hasn't changed my life, but it was an interesting take on someone setting a goal and meeting it - however arbitrary and supposedly trivial. The book is one woman's perspective, and if you don't like it, you won't like this book - just as with any book. She talks about being strongly opinionated politically, flipping out on her loving husband, and having a grubby kitchen - things many of us have done in one way or another. She describes how setting a goal related to something in life that she loves, rather than the job she is compensated for, frustrates and fulfills her. She finds her interests and talents later in life. Yes, she drinks, curses, and mocks strange and delusional suggestions related to the events of 9/11. She is not an insensitive, evil bitch - she is funny, irreverent, and has written a very funny book that is a quick and enjoyable summer read. Loved it!"
85,1,"oh, go ahead and read it!: I thought it was hilarious. It was as crazy as if any of the rest of us mere mortals tried to cook all of Julia\'s recipes in a year. UGH! I couldn\'t have stomached most of the recipes myself, but the reading is great fun!I loaned my book out the minute I finished it so someone else could have a lot of laughs. I hope the loanee\'s not as stuffy as the other ""reviewers"" on here."
86,1,"Maybe I identified too much! But I loved it!: Ok- I too am coming on 30 this year. I too love to cook. I too am a slob in the kitchen (and out). If you get through this book you\'ll see why I may have found myself enjoying it because I could identify with Julie Powell a bit; but it had great things to offer besides-things outside my realm. She does a great job laughing at herself and her predicaments and I enjoyed going along for ride. It is not ""great writing"" but it is worthy of reading and the story and laughs make up for it. Enjoy it over a weekend!"
87,1,"Funny and light with a hint of meaning thrown in.: I love cooking and this was a great light and funny book. So what if some of it is made up? So what if it was a blog? (so what if there were grammatical errors) Just like the cooking project, if it works for you then it is worthwhile. This book worked for me, I liked the peek into someone's life, I now want a project of some kind too. Don't worry I won't be blogging!"
88,1,"Best book I\'vd read in a very long time!: I picked up this book at the bookstore thinking it was another of those ""chef teams up with Julia"" things. As I read the blurb on the cover I was immediately intrigued so I bought it. I read the entire book in 2 days and LOVED it! I felt like Julie was me, or I am Julie. She has so many of my own issues and she is honest and unapolagetic about herself. Someone earlier was offended by the Republican bashing--so what? Get over it. I have the same copy of MtAoFC and I referred to it as she talked about the recipes. I have to agree that aspic is pretty nasty! But it had to be made to accomplish the goal. Long review short--I absolutely adored the book and am looking forward to anything else written by Julie Powell!!Jennifer Alamdari"
89,1,"Oh, lighten UP, folks!: I liked this little venture into one woman's obsession. She wasn't trying to write Larousse's Gastronomique, for heaven's sake. It's just a fun little chicklit type of memoir. Quirky and cute. Just don't look for big a big emotional work of art or for a cooking how-to. Go aloong for the ride and enjoy it."
90,1,"Messy, disastrous, and wonderful: Delightful! Powell has a natural, anecdotal voice that draws you into her chaotic life. She\'s even able to present her impulsive decision to cook all of the recipes from Julia Childs\' ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" as a sort of valiant last stand against the increasing mediocrity of her life. Powell lays out the ensuing year of culinary obsessiveness in all of its messy detail. This is a great read if you\'re at all interested in Molly Ivans-style wit or the down-to-the-wire suspense of an episode of Iron Chef."
91,1,A Cooking Memoir: This memoir is perfect for anyone with any interest in cooking. You'll enjoy the humor and the imagined conversations with Julia Child
92,1,Very Satisfied: The book is interesting but has far too much profane language for an older conservatve reader. I find it difficult to believe that Julie Powell actually talks the way it is written
93,1,"Cute, Engaging, and a Fun Read for any Julia Child Fan: When I started reading this book, I honestly wasn't thrilled at first. It seemed to me the writer was trying too hard to be humorous and spent too much time thinking up clever witticisms instead of focusing on the content. But as the book progressed, she seemed to relax into her writing and it became far more fun for the reader. The pacing is a bit uneven here and there, and yes, she does take us off on unrelated tangents occasionally; in the end, however, it only adds to the endearing quality of this unabashed and heartfelt tribute to the greatest cook in American history.I admire Julie Powell's courage in tackling a project of this magnitude - as a long-time Julia Child devotee, I was relieved to see someone else had the same *&^%$ struggles with marrowbone that I did - and, although Julie, her husband, or her family might curse me for even suggesting it, I wouldn't be disappointed if she decided to tackle MtAoFC, Vol. 2."
94,1,"Enjoyable read: Got through the book quite quickly as its an easy and enjoyable read. It inspired me to cook more French recipes and not fret about it too much. I do feel however that the swearing was slightly unnecessary and annoying - but if that's who she is, then at least it is authentic."
95,1,"Delightful: Mmmm...Biography & Memoirs? or Cooking, Food & Wine? A little of both. But it really doesn't matter what this book is about because Julie Powell can write. The account of her self-appointed task to prepare all the recipes in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking never bogs (blogs?) down; she weaves into her book stories of Julia's introduction to cooking and her own bouts with infertility and her friends' relationship ups and downs as well as, of course, her experiments with French cooking. Delightful."
96,1,"Laugh out loud fun!: Julie & Julia is a really funny, fun light read that's engaging from first page to last. The type of book that's great to escape into... grabs you from the beginning and leaves you smiling at the end.Julie is easy to recognize (she's a little bit of all of us) and her adventure into French culinary cooking is hysterical. I'm now looking forward to seeing how they capture the essence of this charming book on screen.The only bad part about this book is I kept getting hungry! Will now have to dig up some Julia Childs cook books and whip up a few treats (and laughs, I'm sure) of my own."
97,1,"I thought it was funny!: Yes, Julie whines, but it's because her life is at a standstill! Who hasn't been in a situation in life where things get stagnant? I agree that the way she wrote about 9/11 was a little insensitive - it was cringe-worthy. But, c'mon, anyone who dares to plow their way through a cookbook such as this one, probably the best ever written, has to get some kudos! I have to admit that while reading the segment with the maggots had me laughing 'til I was crying. My only hope is that the movie doesn't make Julia Child look foolish. I hope she is portrayed as the smart, talented, remarkable woman she was. My only regret is that I didn't stand in line at the bookstore when Julia was signing copies of her last book. My loss. I want Julie Powell to keep writing."
98,1,"Julie and Julia: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Julie's voice is clear and her message of her life opening up by taking on a daunting, but exhilarating task - and thereby, gaining joie de vivre - is delightful!"
99,1,"Fun read: I enjoyed this book a lot. A twist on Bridget Jones. Made me want to try cooking. also a good sttement for enjoying the simple things in life . . . good friends , good food, and running water!"
100,1,"Okay book, better film: The book is okay .. always interesting, but Julie's a bit tiresome with her incessent drinking and swearing, she reminds me of a teenage boy .. ho hum. But the book made me eager to see the film, and THAT was fabulous .. less Julie (and a cleaned-up version of Julie was welcome), and MORE Julia (aka Meryl Streep, who outdid herself in the role). The film had a pulsating, beating heart that the book lacked .. but both had food, glorious food. Bon appetit indeed!"
101,1,"Haven't seen the movie, but enjoyed the book!: The book was recommended to me before the movie was announced. I purchased it at an independent bookstore, and didn't read it for several years. When I finally got around to it . . . well, all I can say is that I was fairly entertained. I can't imagine why anyone would actually WANT to cook that much! But I was entertained, if a little grossed out, by the story. I haven't been able to eat lobster since, and have eaten very little chicken. But I did go out and buy a lot of butter, and cooked with it more often. I don't know what that says -- all those recipes, and the thing that appealed to me was cooking with butter . . . maybe I am just not attracted to French cooking . . .I think I'll skip the movie."
102,1,"Abstract thinking in art: I admit to a special fondness for Walter Foster's old publications. This book, as yellowed as the pages may be, is fun. If, like me you have done rigorous training in formal drawing and painting and mastered the principles and are very happy about having done the discipline but now want to break out, this is a really helpful book. It features several styles of work and most importantly how the artists arrived at their processes. It will loosen your artistic process right up. Originally $1.00, it was probably published in the 1960's and is still relevant today."
103,1,"Twisted Tale of Captivity: Jack Ketchum delivers another discomforting look at the dark side of human nature. A bizarre, sadistic couple of right-to-lifers kidnap a pregnant woman in front of an abortion clinic, hold her captive and engage in various forms of physical, psychological and sexual torture. I don't know why, but I couldn't put it down. Very graphic and descriptive as Ketchum tends to be. Not for the faint-hearted."
104,1,"Always Pushing The Envelope - Another Ketchum Classic!: While there's nothing supernatural in Jack Ketchum's terrifying thriller, Right To Life, the monster in this tale - like most of his work - is all too real, taken right from the headlines of today's news. At first, I was hooked on the mystery of why this innocent woman was kidnapped and wanted to know more about her kidnappers and their motives. However, the reasoning behind their actions didn't seem as effective as it could have been. Maybe that was an easier way out instead of writing about someone doing this because of their belief in saving a precious life, doing anything they can to protect the baby that grows inside of our main character. Regardless, it was an enjoyable read and one of Ketchum's stronger works, along with The Off Season, Offspring, Old Flames, and The Girl Next Door - my favorite of his books."
105,1,A Great deal for the money: I just received my router and I am very pleased with it. I have never owned a plunge and so the weight took some getting used to. When I was shopping for a plunge router all the other 3.25HP routers were selling for about ... more the the Freud and since I would Freud router bits and the reviews at the time were positive I went for it. Amazon was offering a $15 coupon and a free edge guide at the time. So I paid a little of ...I believe. Nice going Amazon and the router is great.
106,1,"Good with the novel: I\'m into the seventh of the ten chapters of this miniseries. If you\'re following along with the novel (I recommend the Pevear-Volokhonsky translation), you\'ll be pretty impressed. The subtitles are pretty bad, e.g. ""chores"" for ""chorus."""
107,1,"Great Acting, real good movie: Yes, it is a great movie, the actors are great (did you see Mironov in ""Metamorphosis"" (by Kafka)- he is an impressive actor there as well as in Idiot). However, I watched this not using subtitles and my friend who did, agreed with many other reviewers - she called the subtitles ""rudimentary"", just that she knows the novel too well, so it did not kill the pleasure... Because of that I give four stars, not five - for ability to share the joy of viewing is also a factor and translation is a part of the finished product as it is sold in here..."
108,1,Great gift for co-worker: I bought this as a gift for a co-worker. It is so cute and she really liked it. The magnet is strong and holds the paper clips just like a drop of water.
109,1,"Great Book: This book taught me a lot about plays and how they're written, and the different and various elements that are required to make good and well-written plays. I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants a good read!"
110,1,"Fabulous Product!: These things are indispensable for moms of new babies. They come in quite a few colors and fabrics, so you can get ones that are appropriate for any season. We had about 6 that we used for my son up until his 8 month birthday or so when he decided he didn't want to be swaddled while sleeping and graduated to regular blankets. They wash & wear very well and are especially great for parents (like us) who never quite mastered the art of forming a 'baby burrito' with a regular blanket. I bought 2 of these for a friend with a new baby and highly recommend them!"
111,1,"Pros and cons: I have 2 fleece ones. Got one as a gift and then I bought an extra one later because baby spits up sometimes.Pros:Baby sleeps peacefully in itCan wrap the baby's arms tight so she doesn't squirmMakes breastfeeding easier -- no hands in the way!Cons:The bottom part where her legs go is not long enough-- it starts her kick-reflex and it frustrates her sometimes. I have to shush her for a few seconds then she forgets about the problem.My baby slides down into the bottom part sometimes (even though she is wrapped tightly) and the top part of the wrap starts to cover her mouth and eventually her nose. I have to re-wrap her when this happens (this happens mostly after I burp her after feedings). She does not like the process of being wrapped, so I have to calm her down.I would still buy another one of these if needed and I do plan on getting the bigger size once she gets longer/bigger."
112,1,"100% awesome: Our baby started sleeping through the night within days (I had to wake him up to feed him), and I largely attribute it to this swaddle me. It's easy to put on once you get the hang of it, and although it looks a little like a pea-pod straightjacket, it works!! I would never have another newborn without it."
113,1,"Three cheers for swaddling: The difference that swaddling makes is just short of miraculous and this product really does the trick, once baby fills it out. Our son is now about 11 pounds and he fits nicely into the small. We tried to use this on him when he first came home at 6.5 pounds, but it swallowed him, so we used receiving blankets. Both served their purpose, but SwaddleMe is faster and more secure. He's a little Hercules now and can easily wiggle out of a blanket.One thing - I recommend the cotton over the microfleece if you live anyplace south of the Yukon. The fleece made baby really hot at night. The cotton is breathable, but still warm.Lastly, a confession - When I went to purchase a specialty swaddling blanket, I bought this one in part because of the price. I'm glad I did. It gets the job done without breaking the bank."
114,1,Swaddling is a lifesaver!: Great product. I love the SwaddleMe blankets. My 3 month old sleeps incredibly well and I believe swaddling is what made this possible. My only problem with this blanket in particular is that the cotton is very stretchy and she can actually escape the swaddle most nights. We had the flannel version before this one and did not have that problem with it. I'd definitely recommend this product but I'd suggest the flannel version!
115,1,"We LOVE this!!: We absolutely LOVE this product. Our daughter did not like being swaddled in a receiving blanket because she doesn\'t like to have her arms restrained so I didn\'t even bother with this. She tends to startle herself awake and throws her arms out to the side and has to be put to bed all over again. I decided to give it a try one day (when she was about three weeks old) and she was asleep within minutes. Better yet, she stayed asleep for hours. She is now two months old and we use this every night - she is sleeping 8-10 hours each night. The velcro stays closed and I don\'t worry all night that the material has covered her nose. The material also has just enough ""give"" that she can still move her arms a little but not enough that she wakes herself up. It is totally worth $10 and mom, dad and baby are all well rested!"
116,1,"Best at keeping baby swaddled: I was never very good at getting the blanket to say on as a swaddle. My baby is something of an escape artist even when I did it right. The swaddle me is easy to fasten and hard for him to wiggle out of. (It is possible, just hard)It can keep him swaddled the whole night like a blanket never could. Great product."
117,1,"These are great!: These swaddleme covers are a great help with newborns and infants. They feel secure and sleep better, longer. Try it, I think you will love it! They make great gifts."
118,1,Swaddle blanket: I can't say much about this as I have not used it yet. My baby is due in July but it seems to be really nice and I am sure she will use it when she comes.
119,1,SwaddleMe swaddler: I love this swaddler. Also used the fleece one for my son when he was newborn. He sleeps better than any of my other children did (I have 7) and I wish I would have bought one before. My son has only managed to wriggle out of this swaddler when I have failed to tuck him in properly. Most nights I wrap him in at around 9pm. He wakes at 2am for a feed and ALWAYS goes straight back to sleep. I unwrap him about 7am when he is nice and refreshed after a good sleep.A great product that I wish I had had for my other kids.
120,1,"baby shower gift: i got this for a co-worker who was having a baby boy - she used it a lot for swaddling his first few months and really liked it. After he out grew it she used it as a regular blanket, and still really liked it."
121,1,"CUTE!: I have not given birth to my baby yet, but I can wait to use this to swaddle my baby. Its soft, warm, and so cute!"
122,1,"Amazing!: Love the swaddle-me- however, note that the cotton stretches a LOT faster then the microfleece versions"
123,1,great product great seller: great product.. and very happy with the seller. Item arrived on time and in great condition. The swaddleMe is the perfect size. Loved how easy it is to use..we no longer use it but highly recommend.
124,1,"MAGIC!: My 3-month-old is very strong and always escapes ordinary swaddle blankets within minutes, but refuses to sleep without a tight swaddle. I should have used this from the beginning! The velcro is strong enough to keep him from escaping and the ""large"" size seems like it should hold for a few more months at least. What\'s most amazing... ever since he first night I put him down in this swaddle, he has SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT EVERY TIME! It\'s a miracle!!Plenty of room for kicky feet, has a seat belt hole in the back (haven\'t used that) and the material is soft and light like a t-shirt."
125,1,"Makes 2 month old baby sleep 8 hours!!: I think my title explains this product perfectly. My 2 month old has slept 8 hours during the night for the past 3 nights and he's been consistently at 6-7 hours before that. I had a size smaller first and then upgraded to the larger size. He easily sleeps in it in his crib with no issues. Occasionally, he'll pop an arm out, but it's usually b/c I didn't secure the flaps tight enough. GREAT!!!"
126,1,"Lightweight SwaddleMe: The large size was big enough to swaddle our 5 month old Grandson and lightweight enough to do so in these hot summer months. If you have never used one, pay close attention to the diagram about how to use it. For babies who need that wrapped up security, it is really helpful; and the large size makes it possible to wrap an older baby when the usual receiving blankets become too small. We are all very happy with this product."
127,1,"A bit pricey, but effective: These work great to keep babies soothed and comforted to help them fall asleep; babies who would otherwise flail their arms and keep themselves awake. You decide! My twins just outgrew the small size, so I'm upgrading to medium.4 stars only because of the price."
128,1,Baby loves it: Great swaddle blanket - much easier/more stable than swaddling the baby with a traditional blanket. They hold up really well in the laundry & breath enough so he doesn't get sweaty.
129,1,"Great product!: My ds was kicking himself out of a swaddle in the hospital as a newborn, but when he was having trouble sleeping at 4 months, this helped. He quickly outgrew it, but I'm definitely keeping this around in case we have another one!"
130,1,Best one so far!: We've used a few different swaddle blankets and this is my favorite. Stretchy cotton knit allows you to wrap the baby really tight but not overheat in the summer. The velcro stays out of the way and doesn't poke the baby. You can also swaddle with one arm out. Beats the Miracle Blanket and Halo Sack in my opinion. Cheaper too.
131,1,Great invention: I wish I would have known about these when my baby was born. And where were these 10 years ago when my first was born? I WOULD highly recommend these in whatever style. They are one of the best baby shower gifts and whom ever you buy these for will love this gift above all. Especially first time parents. But seasoned parents will love this too...
132,1,"Works great!: These blankets are great! They keep my son swaddled and happy - we have tried so many blankets and swaddlers and this is one of the only kinds out of which he can't wiggle. The cotton fabric is nice and stretchy, and it's much cheaper than the Halo Sleepsack swaddler. The small size was perfect from birth until 2 months (11 pounds), after which we upgraded to the larger size. You do want to be careful and not overdress your baby if using one of these since my baby gets pretty warm in it."
133,1,A must for your baby...: I just have to say that if you have a baby or know someone that does this is the item for you. It is the perfect item to wrap your baby in to feel secure. We used to use a cloth diaper to wrap up the baby years ago but now they have come up with this and it's perfect. Get a few of them you won't want to be without it.
134,1,"Nice Swaddler: This is the only swaddler I used with my daughter. I had no problems with it. The only thing I would mention is that this one was a thin cotton, while the other one I had was fleece. I recommend you decide which one to buy based on the season. This one filled its purpose."
135,1,"Easier than blanket swaddling, to be sure!: I love the soft fabric and how simple it is to use the SwaddleMe. My daughter prefers to have her arms up and out of her swaddling though, and the SwaddleMe is a little bit awkward when the necessary adustments are made (note that it\'s not actually meant for this kind of wrapping). If it were made just a little bit more ""adjustable"" I think it would be more appealing. Additionaly, at just under 9lb, my newborn daughter won\'t fit in it for long, so if your newborn is larger, keep this in mind. All in all though, I\'m happy with the SwaddleMe and pleased not to have to wrap and re-wrap her in a receiving blanket all of the time. It\'s a good deal for new parents."
136,1,"AWESOME for the swaddling impaired: Hubby and I could just never quite get the swaddle-in-a-blanket thing figured out. No matter how snug we'd do it, our son always managed to wiggle both of his hands and arms free. This product made swaddling 10x easier, and was 100x more effective than our own efforts! Makes life MUCH easier on us both.We found the cotton ones were more snug (and stayed swaddled) better than the fleece. Regardless, DEFINITELY worth the $$. I suggest buying at least 2-3 to have on hand."
137,1,"Dads! Buy a Few and Sleep Better: I'm a father of two, one is currently swaddled in this. She sleeps in this. No crying! Buy a few as your wife will want to wash it when the infant spits, throws up, etc.."
138,1,"Bundle of Joy: Our one-week-old baby loves his SwaddleMe. It quiets him instantly and keeps his feet and hands warm. It also makes him easier to carry. Best of all, he looks like a little pea pod."
139,1,This is a magic blanket!: The first time we used this blanket our two month old baby slept through the night. (9 hours!) It was a life saver. The only downside is that they actually come in three sizes. Babies R US online only carries the medium size. It is too big for our baby so she can wiggle out of it and one time ended up with it around her neck. (it didn't impair her breathing though)
140,1,"Colicky baby? This is for you!: I was given this as a gift & left it in the package for some time. As a new mommy, I thought sleepless nights were part of it, until I visited my family when she's 3 months old. I finally tried this & wish I had much sooner! My daughter HATED being put into this (it's a little tricky @ first), but would quickly nod off to sleep after she was in it. We didn't like putting her in it either, it was a last resort, b/c it felt like we were torchering her b/c we had to make it tight enough. We & she couldn't have slept w/out it on MANY nights!!! You MUST use the velcro, as it's shown. Figure it out b/c it's the only thing what will keep your baby in tight, if he/she is fidgety & strong!"
141,1,"Great Wrap!: My Daughters love to wiggle and squirm and can get out of anything I wrap them in! This wrap seems to do the trick! Yes, they do get out of it sometimes but it is the best thing that I have found to swaddle them with!!"
142,1,"AWESOME and a great pRICE: The small is up to 14 lbs the large is 15-22 lbs for you moms who need to know ..will this fit my baby....WORKS like a charm!!! use w/ a swing and the soothing sounds sampler from Amazonor your own sound machine and baby quiets down beautifully. Very safe, keeps hands away from scratching baby's face, secure and warming...obviously use cotton in summer, microfleece Fall/Spring and flannel for Winter.also many believe this helps prevent SIDS..I don't know about that, but it can not hurt in my opinion.GREAT pRICE... check around, this a deal!!!"
143,1,Great Product: Was very useful the first 3 months of age after that she broke free wothout any trouble.
144,1,"A Must Have For New Moms: This is by far the best baby product for a good sleep. My son couldn't sleep without being swaddled because he jerks his arms around and wakes himself up. But he always seemed to get his hands out of the receiving blankets (no matter how large or how tight we wrapped him). We even started calling him Houdini.Then we got the SwaddleMe. They worked great and he doesn't wake himself up now. In fact, now when it is nap time, we put him in his SwaddleMe and give him his pacifier and he immediately calms down and goes right to sleep."
145,1,"Pretty good: This swaddle blanket is pretty good but not awesome. It's gotten easy for my baby to get out of, or get tangled in, now that she is 3 months and can use her arms. I am not sure what to do now since she wiggles out and wakes up. But until now it was a great deal for its price."
146,1,"Just as it appears in the pictures...: I was quite pleased with this item when it arrived. It's a gift for my pregnant daughter, so I won't know how useful it really is for awhile. I do know that it's soft and pretty, and appears to be a secure way to swaddle the baby."
147,1,"wonderful product: This helps keep the baby swaddled and cozy. My 2 month old sleeps much longer in this product. The fabric is thin enough that the baby doesn't get all sweaty as with the thicker fabric offered.Weird but cute comment: With this color and print, when the baby wiggles he looks like a catapiller with a human head. That provides much laughter at my house."
148,1,"Capital Punishment: First I want to say that I really enjoy reading this and all the others on my Kindle.This is a story that keeps you in suspense as you travel with the characters throughout. It does start out a bit slow, but as you get into the story, it keeps you on your toes. I found myself getting antsy as the characters finally got to realize just what was really going on with the white leader as he used the black characters.All in all, I found this to be a worthwhile read, especially in this day and age."
149,1,let your expectations go: What I did not know when I brought this was this was the same author who wrote the awful book called simple simon which was made into a truly awful film called mercury rising. If i had known I would never have brought this book. It was a good read and kept you hooked until the end.
150,1,Good Read: This might not have had the nuance or maturity of Grisham or Baldacci but the story is great and the prose is solid. Thanks for the read!
151,1,"Loved the characters and the setting: I read a lot of romantic suspense books, and this is one of the best I\'ve read in a long time. The author describes the people and places so vividly that I felt like I was there. The descriptions of Ireland really set the book apart. The characters were so fully developed and the plot so tightly written that the outcome was exciting and completely believable.If you like books like ""Rebecca"" and Isabelle Holland\'s adult romantic suspense, you\'ll love this novel. It puts real emotion back into romance."
152,1,"Informative....: This book was very informative and had very interesting theories. You have to remember it is by Freud, so there are a few parts that you may have to read over more than once to get the theory. For the most part I thought it was a very interesting and informative book. A lot of the theories that he talked about were very very briefly noted and I feel that he could have gone into a lot more detail than he did."
153,1,freud hg100: this purchase was a part replacement for the freud edge banding machine and is a perfect match. if buying this for the same purpose just make sure to keep the deflector from the end of your old one as it is angled and the one you receive with this is straight.
154,1,"She\'s tough!: ""Buttercup"" is a Portables board book; it is part of a series devoted to characters from the ""Powerpuff Girls"" TV show. This one is all about Buttercup, who is described in the opening sentence as ""the toughest Powerpuff Girl.""The small, sturdy book uses simple sentences and brightly colored illustrations to describe Buttercup. Such characteristics as her dislike of baths and her love of competitive sports are covered. Overall, a treat for \'puff fans young and old."
155,1,"THE classic book of still-hunting--: First published in the 1880s, this is the first book ever written on American field sports. It helped inspire the craze for literary stories of hunting (carried on by Charles Sheldon, TRoosevelt etc.) amd was considered by both those men the best book ever written on the still-hunt. Written in the second person, it walks the reader through the process of learning to look for, stalk, and eventually shoot at deer, while drawing moral lessons on the evils of hunting ""the wrong way."" Van Dyke was esp. concerned with hunting techniques prevalent in places such as the Adirondacks at the time, shooting deer while swimming in water, etc., and his encouragement of sport by and for gentlemen helped set the stage for widespread prohibition of working-class and subsistence hunting techniques. Charming, gorgeously written, and immensely entertaining, this is a great book marking one of the most important turning points in how Americans thought about hunting and what it meant."
156,1,"My No Trump Has Improved!! Yea!!: Basic bridge at its best presented in a fun and easy to read format, order both of her books together. I learned so much when I read this book that I hadn't learned from my bridge lessons (the book the instructor used)and what I hadn't picked up in my 4 years since of playing bridge. She knows how to explain so that it makes sense on how to play the hand ~ and now it feels so good to be doing it the right way! ~~ Dorothy teaches about card combinations, reading the cards, playing both no trump and suit contracts. And now I know the safety play, end play and squeeze play tooooooo. ~~ This is a book that I need a refresher on periodically, so my copy is well used."
157,1,"Good Taste But There Is Better: This is a good tasting tea, but I found that the Mango Tea from ""HAWAIIAN ISLANDS TEA COMPANY"" is better tasting. The flavor is bolder, in my opinion.Mango Maui Black Tea 20 Tea bags"
158,1,Enjoyed this Book!: This was a 'fun read'. The characters were vivid and entertaining - even the supporting people had enough of a 'background' to be interesting ie the school principal Mr. Pennystacker who had a Saint Bernard called Mad Dog when he was a child. Millicent is an inventor-in-training and misadventures are a natural result of her best efforts to help others. I enjoyed the subplot with her Uncle and lost Aunt as well - it allowed the author to introduce some of the best characters in the book. I hope there will be further 'Misadventures' to come!
159,1,"Fantastic: What can i say, I have had Amazon for a long time . Amazon is customer friendly and great prices, I have purchased well over 300 items from amazon and never had a problem.Sgt. Maj. R. Huberretired USMC"
160,1,"Nice guide to start salmon fishing.: The book, How to Catch Salmon : Advanced Techniques by Charles White, is a great book to start learning how to fish for salmon. All the techniques seemed modern and feasible. It will make a fine addition to anyone's fishing library."
161,1,"Great wireless hookup.: I have a desktop that is not wireless and a laptop that is. With this adapter and a wireless gateway, I now have two computers that are wireless. It does what it is supposed to! The only drawback is the cradle that is supposed to hold the actual adapter. The plastic is flimsy and too short causing the adapter to tip it over or fall out of it; in addition, the velcro tape that is supposed to hold the cradle in place with the adapter in it is too small and cannot do the job. The adapter is too top heavy and pulls the plastic cradle down no matter where it is located (I even added extra Scotch tape). The cord of the adapter, which is now plugged into the front USB port of my desktop CPR, now dangles rakishly over the top and down the side of it. Next time, I'll get one without a cord. But it works great!!"
162,1,"Vista Compatible Excellet 54 Mbps USB Adapter: Found this Netgear USB adapter and ordered it. Wow, it is so easy to install and the wireless signal is so stronge. It connected at 54 Mbps most the time. I ordered one after another and have three already. Try it with Windows Vista Home Premium, just in a second it found the driver from my hard drive and connected in few seconds. Very impressive for this adapter."
163,1,"Super simple!: Purchased my first wireless adapter to use with MSN TV2 unit. Read the reviews & ordered with some hesitation, as this was my first attempt at wi-fi.Much to my joy, it worked without hesitation. I did make sure, however, that I matched the Netgear brand to my wi-fi router. I connected it, gave it a minute or so (just in case), turned on the MSNTV2 & it worked flawlessly! Right now, it's operating in the next room, but have no doubt it will have range through the whole house.Thanks to Netgear!"
164,1,good: A very good product that i w ill recomend to my friends and family and hopfully last long and make futher binesses with v-chomp
165,1,Perfect: Perfect no complains it woulds exactly how id expect it to be working. with my computer. The other sales of the usb was for my MAC not my WINdows.
166,1,"Great service from fastfriendlyservice: I am very glad and so impressive from the services from fastfriendlyservice.I ordered a NETGEAR WG111 Wireless USB 2.0 Adapter (54 Mbps) sometime last Dec through Amazon. However, I did not receive the shipment even though the record from USPS showed home delivery. This matter remained a mystery for the reason why USPS delivered but I did not receive.I tried but not much hope to resolve this issue since the seller did ship the adapter. Because of that, it is not the seller\'s responsibility. However, the seller ""fastfriendlyservice"" sent me emails and saying would like to ship me a replacement. I received the adapter yesterday.I highly applause the services from fastfriendlyservice because of their handling customer issues with professional attitude and trust. Although adapter is a small order, but my on-line ordering with fastfriendlyservice gave me very pleasant experience."
167,1,"NetGear WG111 is what you need: I ordered this product. It arrived when promised, 2 days later. I plugged it in and it worked. Who could ask for anything more. This is the way things are supposed to be."
168,1,NETGEAR WG111 3 USB Wireless (Dongle): This version of the NETGEAR WG111 software has too many bells and whistles. The original version was simpler to install and use. The next version was more complicated than necessary and this last version is even more so. But they all do a good job and have good range. I've never gotten one that did not work OK. I've used them for 4 or 5 years on various computer brands. Even have had good results using them as the pickup for a parabolic reflector for long range Wi-Fi (AKA Scabbing).This last version I received had a much cheaper USB extension cable than the original. One of them did not work at all but I got by in this case simply by plugging the dongle directly into the USB jack. Can't be beat considering the price. So far I've never had one go bad with use----KNOCK on wood!
169,1,"NETGEAR WG111 Wireless USB 2.0 Adapter (54 Mbps): This product is one of the cheapest Wireless USB adapters available. I bought two. Software not included. Requires purchaser go to netgear and download software. I had issues with install on one computer, but I resolved it. Good Deal."
170,1,"GOOD FOR MAC USERS: I am between Mac Book Pros and wanted to add wireless to an old iBook with no airport card. A card for this costs between $US80 and $US150. i was about to bite the bullet when I did some research and found drivers for this adapter on the Realtek website, maker of the chipset, http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/It works best on PPC Mac right up to the latest OS. I have had no problems. The GUI app from Realtek is not the best designed but for the price its ok. I have used it on a secured and unsecured, and both Mac and PC networks. Be sure to get WG111v2 which uses the chipset from Realtek."
171,1,"Netgear: I've had the product installed for only a couple of days and it seems to be working fine. I had a little trouble with the installation which is why I marked it down. I had to call the company to finish the installation. I probably should have been able to figure out the problem which was: restart the computer after the installation, but I'm not a computer geek. The only thing I wish was different about this product is that it didn't stick out so much from the computer. I'm afraid it might break off or something. So far the speed of the computer etc. all seems to be fine."
172,1,"The perfect movie for a drunken binge: You already know the plot, so I\'ll get right to the meat of it. ""The Fury"" is one of the coolest De Palma movies there is. I first saw this movie on TNT when Joe Bob Briggs did a show called Friday night Monstervision. He did drive-in totals, and I\'m sure those totals would help you now.This movie has: 23 dead bodies. 1, full-torso body explosion. 1 car wreck with crash and burn. 1 boat wreck with crash and burn. 1 car wreck with bloody civilian casualty. 1 former Playmate turned inside out.Hey, the movie sold me with those and it got better from there. How can you resist a movie where a bad guy has no use in one of his arms. Especially when a character asks what happened to that guy\'s arm and Kirk Douglas cooly replies, ""I killed it. With a machine gun."" Now that\'s entertainment."
173,1,"Good cat treat: Good cat treat, pure chicken. My last purchase was not as well received, seemed like they changed something as product was all crushed in small pieces or even into powder."
174,1,"dried chicken: The Natural Freeze Dried Chicken Breast looks very appetizing. My cat loves it. It has become the snack of her choice even though sometimes she likes it mixed with some other dry treats. Sometimes some pieces in the bags are a little dark, almost too dry and hard to chew. In general I have luck and it looks excellent even if pricy. I wish the price would be more accessible for other pets to be able to enjoy pure protein not found in any other commercial product."
175,1,"My cats love this.: My cats love this product. The slightest whiff of it causes them to beg with frantic meows. This is a great product if you'd like to train your cat(with a clicker and a pointer). It's a lot of money for 21oz of chicken though, so it loses one star :("
176,1,"My cat loves these: Xena, my tabby, is a very finiky eater, and she loves this product. She gets three every night before I go to bed, and she will sit at the pantry, waiting for her bedtime treat."
177,1,"My cats love, love, love them!: We have been feeding our cats these ""treats"" for a long time and they absolutely love them, they beg us for them and when they hear the bag opening, no matter where they are in the house, they come running!"
178,1,"He is back after 25 years: This DVD is a must have for anyone who knows about the TV series in the 80s (in my case, the French version called ""Albator"").PROs: The quality of the animation is great and bring up tonnes of good memories. The characters are very well done. Great music!Matsumoto had many years to rework and redefine what he wants to say with these characters and settings.CONs: To much emphasis on the ""look"" of the main character (Captain Herlock). Might be slow at times for people who wants lots of action.Overall: Content: A, Video: A, Menu: B, Packaging: B, Extras: C."
179,1,grows on you: This third venture is more understated but more thoughtful than her previous work. I've listened to it several times now and each time I like it better.
180,1,"Gretchen is good: She did an excellent job on this CD. I believe she wrote 9 of the 11 songs. In ref. to buying it, I already bought it today for $9.72 elsewhere. I do like and use Amazon but price is price."
181,1,Interesting: Ellul discusses anarchy and the teachings of christ. I imagine the average christian would be shocked at the similarities. Ellul is always an interesting read.

183,1,"Good Movie: This is such a great movie. It is very well done. The characters, plot, story are all better. One thing for sure is that SM2 does not have a lame villain like the first movie. My only complaints are that as cool as he is, Doc Ock didn't get that much screen time. And the ending could have been more exciting/"
184,1,Pretty good sequel...: This was pretty good for a sequel but a little more violent than # 1. I wouldn't recommend it for children not use to violence. The story line was okay but just not enough depth to make it better than the first one.
185,1,"Best Movie of the Summer: Spiderman 2 is the best movie this summer.The special effects are amazing. Tobey Maguire is fantastic as Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst is great as his romantic interest. The director really shows you how great Spiderman is, but when he goes back to being Peter Parker his whole life becomes a mess.In addition to the special effects and romance in the movie, there are also may comedic scenes. Very funny scenes showing you how helpless Peter is. The comedy that is inter-woven into Spiderman makes the movie even more enjoyable.See it for the Special Effects, the Romance, the Comedy - or all three... its a great summer movie !"
186,1,"One of the Greastest Movies for years and years to come:: Mr. Tobey Maguire if you read this review I must say to you that your performance as Spider-Man 2 and Peter Parker is one of the best I've seen in years. I'm only hoping that you'll make more of them and not give up on your Spidey Fans. Ms. Dunst and Mr. Molina and others in this Movie all did a Great Job. I recommend this Movie whole-Heartedly to everyone that still believes in Heros. The Movie never slowed for me. I've read some other reviews stating the Movie maybe to long and could have been shortened but I say how when Raimi was and is creating a Character that we all can identify with and believe in and Love for years. Mr. Maguire GOOD JOB! Keep it up because this is one Spidey Fan that Loved this Movie.Smiles, (...)"
187,1,"Wonderful movie but watch it before you let your children.: This is a wonderful movie, however, there are some frightening scenes/images for young children. My 4 year old loves Spiderman and I took him to Spiderman 1 without any problems. During the Spiderman 2 movie there is an operating room scene that I had to cover his eyes and ears until it was over. That was probably the worst thing that happens in it.It is much more action packed than the first one, which is great. There's also more of a love story theme in this one as well. Children over the age of 8 would probably be ok, depending on the child. Younger children could watch most of it too, however beware of more violence in this one."
188,1,"Spider-Man 2.: A little Better than the First, Alot Better than Part 3 that's for sure. Good Movie, Although I can't get over why this guy plays Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Good Spidey Flick and great to watch along with Part 1."
189,1,Great Movie: This is a great movie that I have seen over and over. It is nice to know that my hubby can watch it anywhere now on his PSP.
190,1,"Nothing Short of Amazing: This film is not only the best super-hero movie ever made, but it is easily the best summer blockbuster ever. It evokes every kind of human emotion. The character development is so deep that when Peter Parker is hurt you almost feel as though your best friend is hurt. Now dont get me wrong. Just because i said the character development is deep does not mean that there is a lack of action here. The action is amazing. The special effects are quite literally breath-taking. This movie has earned a spot as one of my all-time favorite movies ever. I love this movie and i dont see how anyone can say anything bad about it. It is simply incredible."
191,1,Looking Forward to Spiderman 3: I want to start by saying I love the Spiderman Series as well as most of these movies that are based on the comic books of my past. I've watched the original Spiderman time after time. Everyone knew after they watched the original that there would be more to come. Unfortunately no movie could ever live up to the great visions concocted in many of our imaginations. Overall I enjoyed Spiderman 2. The special effects were fantastic and the story line was still rather engaging. My only complaint would be that the visions in my head will have to wait for Spiderman 3. I totally overlooked any thoughts of Dr. Octavious. I was expecting to Harry Osborne to put on the mask and become the new villain. Unfortunately all Spidey fans will have to wait for that as young Osborne doesn't start to crack until the end of this film. Overall this film is another great edition in a fantastic series. I'm just afraid that the creators might start milking the series for money.
192,1,I love the special effects!: The special effects in this one are just as good as the first! I think the story line is even a little better. Looking forward to Spiderman 3.
193,1,maravillosa secuela del aracnido: esta pelicula es muy buena supera a la primera ademas de que que esta muy bien hecha y en mayo del 2007 se va a estrenar la tercera parte lastima que todavia falta como un año imedio pero ya se sabe cuales van a ser los villanos kirsten dunst dijo para mt new que son Chris Toper(de that 70s show)como venompero esta es muy buena pelicula no se van a arrepentir de comprarla es de coleccion
194,1,"A Great Sequel To An Action-Packed Caper.: I saw this movie on July 4th and it rocked!! Not only does it move ahead with the story, but the action/romance scenes-of which there are plenty-are well-done. Nice opening credits sequence, which is enough to orient those who haven\'t seen the first movie. There are also plenty of allusions to the first movie as well. The end is not only satisfying, but leaves a cliffhanger for ""Spider-Man III"", coming summer 2006. Everyone in this film was convincing in their roles. Shouldn\'t have been rated PG-13, though there are some frightening images. Keep it up. Better than the first one. Hope the third one exceeds expectations and brings the saga to a close, although making more wouldn\'t be a bad idea; but you better not push your luck. Rated PG for stylized action-violence."
195,1,"MOVE OVER SPIDER MAN 1!: SPIDER MAN 2 KNOCKS THE FIRST ONE OUT OF THE PARK! ONE JAW-DROPPING ACTION SCENE AFTER THE NEXT! BUT THE DIRECTOR WISELY EMPHASIZES CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT OVER THE ACTION AND REALLY PUTS A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR FEELINGS! SO YES, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, A SEQUEL WITH A BETTER STORY THAN THE FIRST. OH YEAH! THIS IS THE ONE TO SEE FOR THE SUMMER FOLKS. FOR YOU ACTION JUNKIES, TWO BLEW THE FIRST ONE AWAY. FOR YOU PEOPLE DESIRING A GOOD STORY, LOOK NO FURTHER. ONE FOR JJ!"
196,1,"go spidy: A good touch-up from the first spider man which i thought was good but spiderman 2 is a deffinant improvement from the original spiderman in all areas, it is obvious the graphics have been touched up, more stunts have been added and a much better storyline eg. doesn't just cut straight to the chase it shows a better lead up. Not being a big fan of marvel myself shows me how good it is and i would think that the fans of the marvel comics would greatly enjoy this. More action has been added and i think that doc. oc is a far cooler super villain than the original one which i hope does not return in the third part to the series( you'll know what I meen after watching the movie). Gets a deffinant thumbs up a must see for you marvel fans enjoy."
197,1,"Not just 8 more minutes--an alternate film: Spider-Man 2.1 isn\'t just the original film with 8 more minutes of footage. Many of the scenes in the film have been recut, with different footage used. It\'s the same basic story, but with an entirely new feel. The elevator scene is longer and funnier, the action scenes are even more exciting, and there\'s a scene with Jonah and Spidey\'s suit that is priceless.The bonus features are good, with a ""Making Of"", commentary, a trivia track and a preview of Spidey 3.Recommended without hesitation for hardcore Spidey fans. Casual fans might want to rent it first."
198,1,spider-man 2 full screen specia edition: it was all great it was like new went i got it and more like he said about it i will buy from him again i give on this a great 100% and more ty cw
199,1,"WHATS THE FILM CALLED AGAIN?: question have you seen this film? if not WHY?if you want to see something that is in-your face non-stop adrenalin rush action thats so fast it makes you sick then this isnt for you what you want is Driving Miss Daisy.Sam Raimi is an incredible director from the evil dead to spiderman, this is the better spiderman so far because the characters are more edgy and the action is more involved. hopefully 3 will be even better."
200,1,"One huge reason to be optimistic: I actually thought the first Spiderman movie was fairly boring, and for the same reason that most super hero movies are boring: a very bad script. I honestly don't know if the second one will be any better, but there is hope! After the phenomenal critical success of the book THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY, which tells the story of two young comic book writers from the early days of WW II, Michael Chabon was asked to write the story for Spiderman II. If you have read that novel, you know what extraordinary ideas he has for comic book stories. There is a very, very good chance that he can elevate SPIDERMAN II to a good space. I actually read an interview with Toby McGuire where he talked about how good he thought the script was.So, keep your hopes up folks! Thanks to Michael Chabon, the second film just might be a very good one."
201,1,"not very Amazing: Sure Doc Oc was done very well and the scene where Spidey stops the subway train was a thrill ride, but once again the slow, Peter Parker scenes just dragged the action to a screeching halt far too many times. I get that a superhero action movie needs to establish the humanity of the character, but does he have to be such a dull dimwit? As far as ""best superhero movie ever"" goes, I\'ll still stick with the first Superman and Batman movies and perhaps even Daredevil. When not in costume, the hero needs to avoid being pathetic or at least be interesting and amusing enough to overcome that state. In his first two big budget movies, Peter Parker has been neither interesting nor amusing while being far too pathetic to engender any sympathy.Better luck next time."
202,1,"4 stars for the film itself, 1 star for the bonus footage: Let me say right off the bat that Spider-Man 2 was a great film the way it was!While Spider-Man 2.1 didn't damage its original predecessor, it didn't add much to it either. Of the new scenes, the only ones that were significant in my view is where Mary Jane Watson discusses her impending marriage to John Jameson with a girlfriend and the added footage of the fights between Spidey and Dr. Octopus, especially on the train! The others were okay BUT weren't really missed.Overall, I still enjoy the new version nonetheless. Worth the money but I'd find it at a lower price than what's there right now."
203,1,"More positive messages from the Spidey's saga: My son and I love watching it together. SM was my idol as I was growing up, and now he is so also for my son. And next time you wish you had more hands to do stuff, watch this movie and think again!! :-) All in all, a good movie!"
204,1,Tobey as Spiderman: I really like Tobey in these movies. Entertaining! Just fun to watch. I would recommend for any age. Give it a try!
205,1,"Spiderman 2 is awsome! I love it!: Spiderman 2 is awsome! I love it! Spiderman/Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kristin Dunst) had a great chemisty in this film! The story was excellent! Doctor Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) was great villian to Spiderman! I like the movie's story, special effects, and great action sequences! Spiderman 2 had eveything I ever wanted in superhero genre movie. I can't say enough about this film. Sam Rami did wonderful job on this project.I love it! Highest possible recommendation.I think Tobey Maguire and Kristin Dunst deserves a-lot of credit for making this movie! The love story between Spiderman/Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson is an important element in this movie!"
206,1,"Pretty good: I like this movie, i think it shows a lot more about Spider-man then the first movie did, the strength was done well, him stopping the train was amazingly done, and anyone who watched the first movie will get a kick out of the scene in the train, when people try to defend Spider-man, much like in the first one, but get taken out by Doctor Octopus, it's filled with a lot more jokes, that add their own flare, the love story is a little cheesy but it's sci-fi, if there is nothing cheesy in the movie, it's not sci fi, i love this movie."
207,1,"EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE!!!: GREAT ACTING!!! GREAT CHARACTER DRIVEN STORY--THE WAY ALL MARVEL COMIC BOOKS USED TO BE!!!

208,1,"Better than the first.: This movie was very good. It was better than the 1st. I saw it July 3rd, and loved it.It was funnier and more creative. Spiderman got tired of getting bad mouthed and actually quit, but soon relized his movie nemisis ""Doc Occ"" was out to get and destroy the world, so Spiderman was back. Great movie, Go See It!"
209,1,Excellent. I loved it!: A great movie but some swearing. A little loud but Awesome. I can't think of my favorite part because I loved it all. It was so good I want to see it again. I thought this movie is great go see it!
210,1,"Like Watching a Comic Book!: I didn't particularly enjoy the first movie, so I was a bit skeptical for this one. The first one had some pretty bad acting and it dragged along getting the whole back story out of the way.Now that the back story was out of the way, Sam Raimi could just take the franchise where it was supposed to go. This movie was like watching a comic book unfold, especially the fight scene with Doc Ock and Spidey when MJ is kidnapped. The acting improved and the characters seemed natural, and the cast fit their roles perfectly. Bruce Campbell had an excellent scene in this movie, and I can't wait to see what he's going to be in the next one."
211,1,"""Go Get \'Em Tiger"": Having never read the comic book, I was not drawn to the Spider-Man movies until I heard friends raving about them and now that I have watched both of them on successive nights, I\'m afraid I am hooked. I enjoyed them both immensley, but agree that Spidey 2 had more meat on it\'s bones and a resolution of some aspects of the story that were welcome. Digitalization done well has to be seen to be believed and the special effects in these movies are highly entertaining and a bit breathtaking. The making of Spidey Three will be a challenge, but I suspect those in charge will be up to it. Until then, these movies are stepping stones to more adventures and having that to look forward to isn\'t all bad."
212,1,"Good Movie from a Marvel Fan: If you enjoyed Spider Man, you'll love Spider Man 2. In many ways it was better than the first movie. I like the way they worked in a number of Marvel Comic book episodes; particularly the scene where Spidey walks away from his Spider Man suit in a garbage can in a dark alley. I also enjoyed the scene where he saves a train load of people on a runaway elevated train and then collapses from exhaustion. They made Spider Man very human and quite ordinary which is great. I'm still getting used to his bioengineered web making abilities which he suddenly loses due to his depression in this movie, but hey."
213,1,"some great effects: if you told me 5 years ago that Tobey maguire was going to be the live action spider-man i would have said ""that awful"". but i would have been wrong. Tobey does an excellent job as both peter parker and spider man. of course the special effects are just out of this world. the reason i did not give it 5 stars is my dislike of Kirsten Dunst. she is not a very good ""mary jane"" at all, with her stewie griffin head and awful hair. this second movie of the series introduces a new character doctor octopus who\'s mechanical arms seem to each have a unique personality of their own. as with the first spider-man the writing is very good, with strong characters(except for Dunst) that fans actually care about. definitely one to add to the DVD collection"
214,1,"BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE: This is the best superhero movie I have ever seen.The acting is great, the story is fantastic, the effects are mindblowing. There is a right balance of action, adventure, romance, comedy all in one fantastic move. The best movie in a long time. Can't wait for Spidey 3! Hope the same actors come back!"
215,1,"That kid doesn't know anything...: Spider-Man 2 was this summer's best film and one of the best this year. The action was amazing. The plot was good. Doc Ock is the best villain I've ever seen in a comic-book based film.I mean... seriously, who would buy a DVD to burn it? That's wasting money. Man, people need to think before typing."
216,1,Ranks next to Empire Strikes Back as better than the origina: Spiderman 2 ranks right up there with The Empire Strikes Backs as one of the best sequels ever made. Sam Raimi super sequel not only blows away the first movie in sheer thrill but also in sheer heart as well. Movies don't get any better than this and I can't wait for the 3rd one.
217,1,"a good movie to watch, no matter how many arms you have.: Spider-Man 2 is better than ever and this time the villan has four mechanical arms. Dr. Otto Octavious is a normal man until his experiment goes wrong, kills his wife, and welds the the intelligent arms to his body and he has to go through a tug-of-war of who controls what because the inhibitor chip gets broken. he then becomes Doc Ock and fights Spidey until almost the very end of the movie where he decides to sacrifice himself and his creation. at the end, the hero gets the girl."
218,1,"Decent: This was decent. It got into the character some more, but the plot was fairly predictable. The graphics were pretty good and the acting was okay. Would recommend only if you had seen the first one and want to see the sequal."
219,1,"Great movie!: I bought this for my kids so they can all watch their own movie in different rooms with no fighting over one movie, so know they all have their own copy of the movie. Works great, no complaints! Thanks"
220,1,"The Best of the Trilogy: The famous Spider Man series second installment is my favorite movie of the series. It's humorous, and has more action than the first film. Overall, I recommend it.Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars"
221,1,"Even better than Spiderman 1: I liked Spiderman 2 even better than Spiderman 1. There were some scenes where he ran around with his suit but not his mask that added some interesting twists. I really liked the ending, but I don't want to ruin it for you, so you'll have to watch it yourself to find out. The second disk that was a documentary about the making of Spiderman was great too. I couldn't believe that Doc Ock was a Brit! He's very different in the documentary than he is in the movie. It was fun seeing all the blue screen stuff too."
222,1,:0): Good job i thought they might fall flat with 2 but i think they did a good job I'm from new york and i was in manhattan yesterday where they were filming spider 3 hope it is as much fun as 1 & 2
223,1,"Great movie, slight cheese: The cheese factor does pop up on a few lines - it seems the writers went a little too over the top with a few lines. A few lines near the end got audible, large laughs that were, actually, supposed to be pretty serious...However, the action was fun, and the critical raves for the movie really are well-deserved.There are lots of callbacks to the first movie, but never so that you'd need to have seen the first movie to understand what's going on here. Recommended to everyone."
224,1,Great Movie sequel!!: I have to admit it first I was more than excited to see Spider-man as being a fan of the first one. I have to say that this was without a doubt the best super hero movie ever actully the best sequel ever!!
225,1,"(4 1/2 stars) Picks up where the original left off.: We continue with Spider-Man/Peter Parker's ups and downs.He meets a more complex villain in Dr. Octopus. Meanwhile, his personal relationships all go in a particular -- and predictable -- direction (DOWNHILL!!!!), he continues to get fired from jobs, his Aunt May can't pay the rent...BUT, this movie has a few surprises for the viewers during and near the end of the film...as well as lead in to what will be Spider-Man 3.(Oh, and for fans of the theme song from the original cartoon series from the 1960s, you'll hear two different versions of it -- one from a street musician and one in the credits, though they're not the original version from that cartoon series.)"
226,1,Best Comic Move EVER!: I thought the first Spider-Man movie was a thrill. This one was 100x better!!! I really thought the trailers would have spoiled the whole movie because they showed way too much but there are scenes they don't show that just blow you away! Dr. Octopus has always been my favorite Spidey villain and he's perfect here! Tobey Maguire really comes to life as Peter Parker in this film. I love the facial expressions he has when things aren't going well for Peter. The story leaves room for at least two more movies and the hints at upcoming villains are enough to ensure that the Spidey series will only get better and better!
227,1,"Decent product for the price: Decent quality picture. Menu/option screens linger a bit longer than i prefer. Upscaling is decent but not optimal. You can see some very obvious hazing/fuzziness of distant objects. I would say upscaling quality is closer to a 720p than a 1080i (but i am no expert). Overall, for a model in the $50 - $70 dollar range i think it is a good buy."
228,1,"Regular dvd player: Easy enough to work dvd player. Had to fiddle around with the menu to set it to 1080p (does not start as default). Upconverting does improve signal slightly, but its not that amazing. It seems to depend on age of dvd its upconverting (ie old movies still don't get the crystal clear/sharp signals of new cgi type movies)"
229,1,should have read more: Only problem I have with this upconverting DVD is that it does not have as optical output. Had to change my wiring setup for my home theater to accomodate. Better than the Samsung unit I am replacing. Will probably get more units for the other rooms that dont have surround.
230,1,"awesome. period.: This was worth every penny spent, plus a hundred more. The upconversion, depending on the source, is brilliant and seemless. For Dvd sources it's amazing. Xvid and divx completely depends on your source, but it's played everything thrown at it; and I've thrown a lot at it. The USB interface is quite simple and has yet to cause any problems. Buy this player if you're on the fence about BlueRay."
231,1,"A tale of two DVD Players.: Not wanting to commit to HD-DVD or Bluray yet I decided to purchase a upconverting DVD player to go with my new HD TV (finally!). My first purchase was the number one choice of a popular consumer reporting website, the Toshiba SD-5000.I could not get the Toshiba to work on an HDMI cable with the TV, only with conventional Audio/Video cables. After the lower tech hookup I quickly noticed that it also didn't have a chapter and minute/second counter on the display! Not satisfied with the product I returned it and purchased a Pioneer DV-400V-K. While forty dollars more expensive it is worth the price difference. Out of the box, plug in the single cable (HDMI), Go to the initial setup and select 1080P and enjoy DVD's in upconverted format. No it is not HD-DVD or Blue ray quality but it is very acceptable and 300.00 less than the forementioned. I'll enjoy watching DVD's on my 120.00 player while the dust to settles in the HD-DVD vs. Bluray battle."
232,1,Great player: I ordered this player so I could play DVDs that were in the PAL system. It works great! Super player for the price.
233,1,"Pioneer DV-400V-K: I Purchsed this player about 1 month ago.... and I am happy with it. It works great, doesnt overheat, resumes where dvd left off, if I stop it. It is very easy to hook up, the Set up if very user friendly. The owners manual really helps with audio/video adjustments. You have the option of changing many audio/video settings to get your movies to look and sound better than before. Who needs blue ray and HD DVD, not me. This player really makes the 480 DVD look like 1080p, check it out for yourself."
234,1,"WOW: I was at the store for 2 hours trying to decide between Samsung, Panasonic, Sony and Pioneer. I have always owned many Pioneer products and so I went with this one, one of the reasons was an easy remote to use in a dark home theater and for the 1080p upscaling. I\'ve seen alot of upscaling players at this price perform, but when I got home and saw this on my 150"" tv with my 1080p projector, wow, this comes close (but does not match) the best expensive upscalers. I am very happy with this product. I wanted the Pioneer dvd recorder, but unfortunately most dvd recorders are only 1080i.Highly recommend."
235,1,"A good DVD player for basic use: Got this in a hurry when our old DVD/VCR player died. Amazing how much smaller the new machines are--this has a small footprint and is only a couple inches tall. I guess I'd just keep that in mind when you figure out where to put it--if you're filling a taller opening (like I was), it will sit right at the bottom. On the other hand, you might be able to double up, I was able to put our cable box and this new DVD player in the space that just used to hold my DVD/VCR.A couple design issues: The words and buttons on the front of the machine are almost microscopic. You'll need bright light and your reading glasses if you want to put commands right into the machine as opposed to using the remote.I was able to program my universal remote to do some of the basic stuff but I still need the DVD's remote to do some of the more complex features.In summary, good machine for the basic stuff, which is really all I use it for."
236,1,"A story of the mountain and the dream: I just recently got done reading this book that I picked up on a trip to the mountain. There is still so much left to see, and i have been down there five times already. The history is rich, and very informative. It is a shame that politics got involved and that the original dream was not able to be fullfilled, but alas we got something"
237,1,"GT Adams Texan: Agree with everything Toronto said and more. My eyes got a little damp as well, watching Andrea's reaction to the audience singing on Runaway. For Andrea, that has to be the memory of a lifetime. What an affirmation of your talents. The duet with Sharon and Caroline was very special. Had not heard either of their voices in solo before. Sharon bowled me over. This talents of this group runneth over with each of them possessing so many that it boggles the mind. I've been hungering for this and the Unplugged DVD for so long that I almost couldn't believe it when I read that they would finally be available with region one encoding. Wonder how much was lost in sales and publicity over the years because these two DVD's weren't availble for the North American market. The Unplugged DVD is enroute and I can hardly wait to watch Andrea sing Little Wing and Everybody Hurts."
238,1,very good book: I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking for truth about this subject.the service was good also.thanks so much
239,1,"Interesting, but where's Fabio?: This book is a very enjoyable, easy read. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high paced adventure story. Only one caution: at times Mr. Smith seems to delve into the realm of smut with his descriptions of the main character's sexual exploits. More swashbuckling please!"
240,1,"Birds of Prey: Another swashbuckling novel from the pen of Wilbur Smith that will not disappoint Wilbur Smith fans. Set in Africa before the British arrived, this novel gives a different perspective to other THE COURTNEYS OF AFRICA Wilbur Smith novels that will cause the reader to become misplaced with the action that exists from cover to cover."
241,1,"No name review: Not the best in the series by one of my favourite writers. Flowery language. If you are not the maritime type you need a naval dictionary to absorb the action. On the other hand a wealth of information of how England built its Empire. Wherever there was no enemy, the Brits always managed to create one. The Boers in Southern Africa are people from the same stock as the Brits. Yet they had to have an enemy in that part of the world also, so the Boer war and many other wars at the Cape, would be inevitable. For good measure Wilburn Smith in this book introduces an old enmity between Moslem and Christian in an area where active piracy is currently taking place! Is this wise? In my view no! I look forwards to the new book by Wilburn Smith.John Taliotis, M.D.Cyprus."
242,1,"A must read for readers of Action and Historical Fiction.: This book has action, adventure, heroes and villains. Fighting,Sex treachery and loyalty. It's a light easy to read book, that really gets the reader involved with the Characters. I enjoyed it tremendously and recommend it to anyone looking for a light action packed read."
243,1,"GREAT!!! Right to the last word of the last paragraph.Thanks: Your characters are alive and well.You had to have been there to write about them,Of course you weren""t but they ALIVE.I will read the rest of your novels.Thanks"
244,1,"what an adventure!: i read monsoon prior to this one and was slightly dissapointed. monsoon sts a very high standard for the series, however i still loved the adventure and bckground to the courtney legacy. i reccomendbooks all the tim and this is at the top of my list!"
245,1,A good book- although I COULD put it down: I have enjoyed several of Wilbur Smith's books and chose to read Birds of Prey based on its reviews. There were parts of the story that I enjoyed but I found some of the graphic sex scenes to be disturbing and totally unnecessary to the plot. Smith went into such detail during some events of the story (like the weird sex scenes) and yet the last part of the story seemed to be rushed through. I found myself interested in the story but not dying to know what was going to happen next (like I felt while reading some of Smith's other books like The Seventh Scroll and River God.) Wilbur Smith is an excellent author and I will probably read Monsoon which is the continuation of Birds of Prey. I hope to be swept up in the adventure and NOT able to put THAT one down.
246,1,"It is a wonderful escape from reality: For those of you who read fiction an hour or so a day, this adventure story will give you something to live for. While reading the book, I relished the thought of getting home at night, exercising, doing my homework, opening a bag of good ole patatoe chips and then the ultimate escape ... cracking the best adventure story I have ever read. After reading Wilbur Smith, Clive Clussler will seem immature and childish. ""Birds of Prey"" is exciting, inspirational, and entertaining. It will pick you out of this world and deposit you in a world so real and vivid that you forget about the confines of your everyday existence."
247,1,Exellent and engrossing read: This ones a page burner that I just couldnt put down.Graphic detail leaves just enough to the imagination to make it a fun exciting read. I dont see how any adveture reader could even be slightly dissapointed with this one !!! By all means buy it !!!! :)
248,1,"Not totally Wilbur: The story of young hal in this book is a bit risque to say the least,but then again,in the contex of Smiths writings he has been anything but conventional.Hal's stories is a whirlwind of adventure and mis adventure that takes him into situations where only the devil may tread.Because it is a comlpeat contrast to his normal writings but he has been changing,since River God and Seventh Scroll.His books are a pure adventure to the mind and gives a freedon to the soul.Keep on Smithy"
249,1,"Good adjunctively or solo: ...When I picked this book up, I thought for sure that there was nothing else to be learned, but I was completely wrong. For once, this book is backed by scientific research and the results are shown for experiments such as positive and negative outlooks, overcoming illness, likelihood to die early, the list goes on and on. 'Emotional Longevity' does not indicate the length of an emotion, but rather teaches us to view things in a light that will produce a much higher quality of life, and will ultimately lead to a much healthier, longer, and more fulfilling, realistic lifestyle. I know it sounds cliche, but it's true. And it's different from all the others to boot.Highly recommended from a person who highly needs good books like this. :) (Who doesn't?)"
250,1,"Original Blue Eyed Soul: A truly 60\'s soul recording. Cochran\'s recording of his most famous piece of material , ""Last Kiss"", is no where close to being the best recording on the CD , but no one sings "" Last Kiss "" like J Frank Wilson. The selections are some of the best 60\'s soul music which never got the air play it should have received."
251,1,"The Unknown R&B Soldier: I knew Wayne Cochran by the single Going Back to Miami. Despite no charted on Hot 100, it was airplayed on Costa Rica\'s first Top 40 radio station back in 1967. Next year a girlfriend honored me with the generic Wayne Cochran vynil for Chess Records which I lost. Those songs are the reason why I kept looking for WC on CD till I found out this Australian release, so what to think...? I dig Wayne\'s energy on up-tempo songs but the ballads ""When My Baby Cries"" and ""I\'m Leaving Up to You"" got a pure classic R&B with those musicians there. You see, not all that shine\'s is gold, but this is gold for those who appreciate such rock and soul or blue eyed soul style."
252,1,The White Knight of Soul!: He's responsible for inspiring Elvis's suits... and he's known as the white James Brown. The album will knock your socks off... enough said!!!
253,1,"The Old Army: Huzzah for Coffman's account of the U.S.Army between Spain and Pearl Harbor. Not only does he trace the organizational evolution of the Army, but he includes many personal accounts of careers in the service to life on posts for the children. It is easy to forget that for forty years American soldiers served in China, the Philippines, and Panama. Coffman also describes the Army educational system at the Command and General Staff School and the War College that developed the leaders of World War II. This account is very comprehensive yet entirely readable."
254,1,Text Book: I buy all of my text books here. Always a great product at an even better price! As always very happy with the customer service and the product!
255,1,"The notes are Awesome: There was notes written all over the textbook, but I can tell we clearly have the same professor since I didn't need to write anything since they are word for word in the sides. Other than that the book itself was a pretty boring (most of it is common sense?) but it is an easy read."
256,1,Simple Read and Informative: A great book for beginners to understand the principles of management. It is simply written to make it easier to understand and really breaks down some principles that we all do in everyday life. A must for all even if not taking a class because all of us will either manage or be managed.
257,1,Big Help: I use the Second edition Fundamentals of Management book for my management class. I really like this and think that is helpful for people to understand the basic management principles and theroies. One thing that i have find very usefully in this boook is the exhibits. The exhibits have helped me understand more clearly different concepts that I would not of understood with out them. I also like the testing page that are found at the end of the chapters. They are a really big help in making sure I understand the main concepts that were covered in that certain chapter.I do plan on keeping this book after I have finished my class at the end of this semester. I will think that it will be an excellent source for me to use when I have started teaching.
258,1,Helped with Management class!!!: This book was extremely helpful and was pre-owned when I bought it but that actually helped me!!! This book helped me exceed in the class and helped ensuring that my major was the perfect fit for me! Shipped quickly and was in good condition! Enjoyed the book very much.
259,1,Journey into Management: I have been studying this textbook all semester for a college course called Principles of Business Management. When I first looked at the book I found it eye catching. They made the book look like fun. I also became interested to learn what was in the book after reading the table of contents. My favorite section has probably been the chapters on leadership. I am very impressed that the authors put so much into this section of the book. They recognize that it is the most important part of management and I agree. We can learn all we want about how to manage but if no one follows our leadership then it is worthless knowledge. I cannot justly say how this book could be improved based on the information it provides. I haven't experienced being in a management position yet so I cannot discern what facts are useful or not. I found the book easy to understand and up to date. It was honestly one of my favorite books that I've used in a course so far.
260,1,"Textbook review: Fundamentals of Management: Here is another review for another one of my classes, Principles of Business Management. The book is a lot easier to follow than the book I recently reviewed; ""Marketing: Connecting with Customers."" In addition to more fluent material, the end of each chapter has questions to help prepare the student for exams, whereas the marketing book does not. Another pro to the book is that the material covered is up-to-date, accurate, and very useful in today\'s management situations. 20 years ago, you couldn\'t really sit down and read/study a book to become a better manager, whereas today it is made possible to do so. Figures, charts, graphs, and examples are also very useful and helpful in studying for exams. Cons about the book is that a few activities or interactive CD-ROM would have made the material more enjoyable to learn about. Overall rating, 4 stars."
261,1,"Business Management: I really like this book, the way it is set up, the way it looks, and the way it is presented. The most useful part of the book was at the end of the chapters was a through chapter test. If every book I had was set up this way I think I would do very well in my classes. Each chapter was well explained and the illustrations and graphics were very good and learning oriented."
262,1,"Great condition, good service: This book arrived a bit later than scheduled, but I didn't absolutely need it by the time of arrival. It was in great condition, just as stated, and was glad that it actually did arrive in a timely fashion coinciding with the given time I had."
263,1,"fast shipping and great comunication: the seller was always prompt to reply to all my requests, I'd definetely buy from them again!"
264,1,Class from Europe: I found this book very easy to read. It flowed well from topic to topic. I was kept engaged by the use of current companies and information. I particulary found that the answers to the learning outcomes very helpful. This book outlines points to know when finished with the chapter. They then answered those same questions at the end. Overall this textbook is very useful for an introductory management class.
265,1,"This book is loaded with important information!: This book contains lot of information. Book describes everything clearly, important concepts are shown very well. Many times important stuff is explained through graphs, and in bold prints or given on the sides. This book would we really helpful in becoming a better manager, it has anormous amout of imformation concerning managenment. Also this book is not very hard to understand. This book gives an idea about the real world, and it shows how things are going to be in the workforce, this book shows path toward better management."
266,1,Fundamentals of Management: I am very pleased. I received the item in a timely fashion and in good condition.
267,1,"Fundementals of Management: I enjoyed reading this book very much. I thought that is was very clear and used very relevant examples to the topic. The chapters flowed together nicely and the chapter summaries were very helpful. The illustrations used assisted the reader in understanding the information and the terms are clearly defined. Not only did I learn management skills and techniques, but also interpersonal communication skills. The author attempts to teach the reader what is most important in the management field and doesn't talk about anything that isn't relevant to the topic. It is straight to the point and easy to read. Overall, the layout of the entire book was put together in an organised manner and specific information is easy to find from the colours used to separate the topics. I would very much recommend this textbook for any Management course."
268,1,"Tis is a excellent book.: I feel that the textbook, Fundamentals of Management by Stephen P. Robbins and David A. DeCenzo, is a good book for the beginning management student. The book made use of illustrating it's points by using graphs. This is important for the students who are having a hard time understanding what the author is trying to say. It's hard for someone to succeed at something if they do not understand the different aspects. I would recommend this book to anyone who is planning to have a career in business."
269,1,"Blood, Gore, thriller, mystery: This book has it all.The story gets a bit confusing at times,but enjoyable nonetheless. I gather from the characters in the story some were from a previous read. I wish the author had tied these characters a bit better because it was frustrating knowing a connection, but just not getting it."
270,1,""" . . . and nothin\' but the proof."": This book is beyond beleif. The authors do more than quote old sources. They actually give it to you. When a Jehova\'s Witness says ""We never taught that,"" you will have the documented proof in your hands. The book contains photostated articles from their organizations early days to the present which show how dramatically their beleifs have changed, and the lengths that their leaders will go through to keep their members fooled. Get this book. Read it, and share it with your Jehovah\'s Witness freind or relative."
271,1,"NOT QUITE HUMAN: THE WEAPON MAKERS by van Vogt is really an oldie that appears to have survived the test of time. Why? The main character, Hedrock, was born immortal by a genetic accident and he has been searching centuries for the secret to immortality, hoping to share it with the rest of mankind. Why? As many old timers assert, it isn't that much fun to outlive everyone you know.What was fascinating about this piece was van Vogt's attempt to portray an immortal human. Here was a character who had access to centuries of scientific invention. Since he was the only immortal, he took it upon himself to decide if and when these inventions should be released to benefit mankind. This is a god-like chore. Who would want this responsibility? Who would want to continue their life under these conditions? Hedrock did. Which goes to show that Hedrock wasn't human. Humans all die on time."
272,1,"Exactly as described: Purchased this for a fun party decoration - attached it to a utility clip light to give a pink glow to the room. Material was of good quality, consistent color and was exactly what I was expecting!"
273,1,"Excellent Western Adventures: Both the opening and closing themes of this classic TV show help to establish the boundaries for an excellent audio/visual Western adventure. All four episodes are built around a formula, but it\'s a workable, proven formula. The plots are well developed for the alloted time and the characters are comfortably predictable.In ""The Train Robbery"" Roy discovers that a local merchant is working with the robbers to take the $50,000 loot. He successfully uncovers the villans and saves the town. In ""Ride in the Death Wagon"" Roy escapes a sinister plot and keeps a widow from being taken advantage of. In ""Shoot to Kill"" an eastern city slicker is caught up in trying to deceive people with his photos, pretending that Pat Brady is an outlaw, but the tables are turned on him. And in ""Ranch War"" Roy saves the day for a young couple in preventing greedy men from taking the family ranch."
274,1,"I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS ONE, AND OH, IT IS JUST KILLING ME IT IS SO GOOD!!!: I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT, THEN AGAIN, WHO WOULDN'T, IT IS SPIDER-MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS MY FAVIROTE HIGH FLYING, GREAT WEBSLINGING ADVENTURE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! AND, IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE IT AS MANY STARS AS THERE ARE IN THE UNIVERSE! I HAVE BEEN ENTICED RIGHT OUT OF MY SEAT AND INTO THE WORLD OF MARVEL, I EVEN FIND MYSELF WISHING FICTION WERE REAL- SUPER-HEROES, AND VILLAINS, BUT WHICH ONE WOULD I BE, ONLY I KNOW."
275,1,"Are you kidding me?: My mother was an enlisted wife and lived in military housing until 2002. I grew up in the navy. This is exactly how it was and is. Maybe it varies by region or base, but there are still major problems for enlisted wives. Poverty, isolation, and depression ARE common. Although there are women who are able to over come these issues, it is not common. Military families deserve higher pay, better benefits (tricare is pathetic) better housing (without asbestos) and access to childcare help/resources. None of this is available which lead to very sad living conditions for MOST enlisted wives. And yes there is extreme classism in the military, anybody who doesn't see it is not on the receiving end of it."
276,1,"First Massage: I can remember when I first started giving massages. Picking out music was one of the hardest tasks. I was in an alternative independent record store when I saw the album Music Mantras I. I used my boyfriend (now my husband), as a guiena pig to give a massage to the new music. It was wonderful! It is one of my clients' favorite cds and is my #1 favorite. My cd got scratched and skips so I am immediately buying one to replace it. The music is very soothing and some of the songs almost angelic-like."
277,1,Classic on UNIX based programming: Its a very extensive book that covers concepts and advanced features of UNIX. It covers UNIX implementation of different features as a user point of view and how to access diffent services of UNIX like OSs. If you want to learn UNIX /Linux based programming this book a must read & must have for reference. I highly recommend this book
278,1,"Absolutely great: This is a solid UNIX reference book. You won't be disappointed. Yes, it does require you to use it's library of functions, but that makes it easier to focus on the important concepts."
279,1,"Very detailed, but well indexed reference: Everything you wanted to know (and probably didn't care to know) about linux.The only drawback are some of the builtin functions that he uses. These are usually uppercase modifications of the lower case functions. It creates one more step for the reader, if they don't want to use his builtin functions."
280,1,"Ali Baba = good entertainment: This is another pairing of Maria Montez and Jon Hall in the Universal series of Arabian Nights-type action and adventure films. The plot is slight (who cares?) but we have the most gorgeous Technicolor ever, with the babelicous Maria Montez! The music is quite good, and the overall effect is quite a handsome film. I recommend it for nice escapist entertainment. I hope Universal Home Video releases the rest of the Hall/Montez series -- they are well worth your viewing time!"
281,1,Simple: Works great. Simply plug & play. I connected it to another 4 port hub that is powered. Everything that I've plugged in works perfectly.
282,1,"Two bands for the price of one!: OK, if you like one song each from both of these bands, you\'re in luck: their biggest hits are on this disc. 5 tracks from The Fixx, including their smash ""One Thing Leads To Another."" Other songs include ""Are We Ourselves?,"" ""Secret Separation"" (their best single ever!), ""Shut It Out"" and AOR hit ""Don\'t Be Scared."" (If you\'re a collector, this is the radio edit of the song, previously unavailable on CD). There\'s also 5 great tracks from The Call, including: ""The Walls Came Down"" (their signature song), ""Let The Day Begin,"" ""Scene Beyond Dreams,"" ""You Run"" and ""What\'s Happened To You"" (featuring Bono on backing vocals). Two great bands for the price of one...what a bargain!"
283,1,Music of the Sixties: Product delivered in a timely manner and in the condition promised - can't ask for more than that!
284,1,"Fast shipping, even with replacement disc: One of the discs did not include all of the video titles, they were more than happy to send me the right disc with no charge and i was able to keep the bad disc."
285,1,"Classics: Is there anyone out there who doesn\'t know these already? I mean seriously, is someone going to read my review and say, ""okay, I\'ll buy this now"". These are Christmas classics. If you haven\'t seen most of them already you probably aren\'t the type of person who should buy this."
286,1,"great classics for a great price: It is a great price for the classics that you get. There are also a bunch of random ones that my kids aren't interested it, but overall I would definitely recommend it! Great classics for a great price!"
287,1,Great movies!: Really good selection of movies! My 5 year old loves this DVD set. There are actually more movies on this selection than I expected. Pleasantly surprised!
288,1,I love these DVDs Brings out the Kids in Me!: I loved these movies when I was a kid and I can now share them with my kids anytime of year I want.
289,1,"Great collection: Many varieties of xmas movies in one place, with some hard or impossible to find outside of this box set. Great buy"
290,1,"love it!: We love it! My kids enjoyed watching the classic Christmas movies. My wife and I enjoyed sharing our childhood times watching these movies. Very fast shipping!thanks,Russ"
291,1,love it: Im so excited to have all the great classics in one place even tho i purchased this used it was in perfect condition now my son can spend every December watching the classics
292,1,Cartoon classic OK: Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
293,1,Christmas DVD: This Christmas DVD has some of my favorites. My children and I will watch these classics for years to come. Shipping on time.
294,1,"Nice Collection of Christmas Classics: I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She really likes the old Christmas movies that are included in this case. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were four, clearly labeled dvds in the case. Each disk displays which episodes/shows are contained on them. It is very convenient, in case you get them mixed up."
295,1,love these classics: i have so much fun watching these with my toddler at christmas. love these classics! great value for so many movies.
296,1,Great: A Christmas Classic! Now I have all my childhood favorites in DVD form so I no longer have to worry about finding a vcr to dvd converter for my old vcr tapes.
297,1,"Good: Great writer, author, and full of unexpected mishappened and trouble, and how to resolve a problem in the past that you can't run away from"
298,1,Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!!: Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!! Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!! Great Item! I am very happy with this purchase!!
299,1,sometimes they come back: It was a great movie as I remembered it as it came out the first time. I recommend it was good.
300,1,"Steve delivers, as usual: This is one of my favorite Steve Martin movies, along with All Of Me and The Man With Two Brains. Apart from being a clever re-telling of the Cyrano De Bergerac (CDB) story, it works brilliantly as a romantic comedy, that is heavy on the comedy.I agree that this should definitely come with some extras, as so many things do these days. Man, would I love to see a blooper reel from this crazy bunch.Recommended."
301,1,"One of Martin's best: An excellent acting job by Steve Martin, among his best. A funny movie that carries a needed message about judging one only on their physical attributes. Fun to watch with a pleasing yet surprising ending."
302,1,"Roxanne: Steve Martin at his best in comedy!! The section in the bar where Steve Martin gives his ""20 better quips other than \'big nose\'"" will have you in stiches. A classic."
303,1,"A nose by any other name...: I have to admit I never liked Steve Martin as a comedian. In this movie, however, he shines, dispalying his excepitonial tallent as both a writer and actor. It's a brilliant piece of work.I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said, except this: If you haven't believed any of the other people raving about this film, take my word for it and buy it. You won't be sorry."
304,1,"Roxanne stills has the stuff: Watched this on Blu-Ray for the first time in many years. While not as impactful when we saw in the first time during its heyday, it still holds together pretty well after all of these years. The story line is classic and is laced with enough Steven Martin-esque humor to keep you chuckling. The dated setting and costuming, hair styles and dialogue remind us of how far we've come since that time."
305,1,"Totally charming & enjoyable: Plenty of charm & wit and comic stupidity in this.Steve Martin is absolutely MARVELOUS in this role - and the role he plays is one you'll totally love. Intelligent, athletic, brave, sweet, charming and witty. You'll enjoy the scenes where he cleans the clocks of stupid men picking on his oversized nose - he does it with total style and humor. And the 20 insults (against his nose) that he comes up with himself are pretty funny.A cute adaptation of Shakesphere's famous Cyrano - although the nitwits who make up the fire department in this little town are just a little TOO stupid for my tastes.But this was indeed overall a charming and enjoyable movie."
306,1,Ham Radio well represented: One of the best films to highlight Ham Radio accurately ... much better than the lame attampts in modern film. And Bonita is a cute little actress... The plots are ok too.
307,1,"Ear Candy: Enya never fails to please. Amarantine is soothing to the ear and calming to the spirit. I play Enya in my office daily in the background and those coming in comment on the beauty of the music. After a long wait, this CD was well worth the anticipation."
308,1,"Love this Music: This is my favorite Enya music for a long time. I enjoy all her sounds, but this album is special. It's really her best for a long time. I recommend this CD."
309,1,"Enya Amarantine CD: I\'m very pleased, not only with the price for the ""slightly used/not new"" CD but for the voice quality and sound of this Enya CD."
310,1,"Soothing: Creates a calm working environment, eliminating stress. Practically immediate arrival to a Soldier overseas!"
311,1,"Enya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya yack yack yack yack yack: Same old, same old. I'm an Enya fan, but the sound is just the same as awlways. It's a good album, but just like the rest. Does she ever just get bored doing the same old, or is she stuck in a duldrum/time warp?"
312,1,"Good. Just good.: This is a good cd. It's obviously similar to her other work, with a few new tunes. The thing I love most about Enya is her haunting vocals, and the tunes are haunting too, but merge into the same sort of tunes. There aren't any stand out songs here, but I do enjoy listening to this overall. Nothing will ever be better than Carribean Blue and Only Time. It's been a long time between drinks, but not quite worth it."
313,1,"Buy this CD!!: This new CD is a gem in the crown of this beautiful woman with a beautiful voice. I never tire of her CD\'s that I have had for years and this is a VERY welcome addition to that collection. This CD is wonderful from the first track to the last and my favorite on it is ""If I could be where you are"". But then, it is difficult to pick a favorite from this CD. They all shine. If you have ever liked any music that is Celtic or any music that Enya has done in the past, buy this CD!! Even for the average music lover this is one of the best, if not the best CD\'s just out on the market. I know this is a CD that I will be listening to again and again!"
314,1,"Amazing collector\'s edition: Here we have -again- an exquisite product, as all made about Enya, again luxuriously finished, again a detailed item. The red velver case with gold stamped logos and titles is just precious. And the contents, the 148 page book, deliciously written by Roma Ryan is the big surprise of this collector\'s edition, full of pictures and of course including the CD and the lyrics of each song, both english and in the ""loxian"" language created by Roma where available.For Enya and not Enya fans, just get this one if you want to know more about the creating process of the album Amarantine."
315,1,"Enchanting Enya: If you like ""Enya"", you will love this C.D.. It has been years since her last recording. This was worth waiting for. At times I am moved to tears by the haunting beauty and angelic clarity of her voice."
316,1,Amarantine by Enya: I love Enya's work and this CD is exceptional. I would buy CD of hers. Excellent!
317,1,"Sounds from Heaven: It is no coincidence that this CD was released on November 22nd., which is associated with St. Cecilia's Day. In John Dryden's Ode to St. Cecilia, he portays St. Cecilia as having a voice so pure that when an angel heard it, he appeared before her, mistaking earth for heaven. This is the best way to describe this Enya CD. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to be uplifted to the sounds of heaven in these troublesome times!"
318,1,"I\'ve learned to shut up... and wait: Like many of you, I felt indifference on first listen to this new CD by one of my favorite artists. But I know well enough now, after feeling the same about the last three releases, to just sit back and wait... and, sure enough, I have found myself turning this on every day, more than once a day, and loving it after all. I think, in a world of downloads and one hit wonders, Enya is the last of the ""album artists"" and knows it. Her CDs feel almost like symphonies where it\'s not advisable to skip around tracks; it\'s like one long movement and you should just hit ""Play"" and let the journey begin. What first felt like droning now fits right into the whole piece like a nice dream. Maybe nothing new but still beautiful -- and, let\'s face it, what do we want, ""The Enya Disco Album?"" We all know we will get MUCH more mileage from this beautiful music than virtually any other CD we will buy this year. A true artist."
319,1,Decent performance by Enya: I would have to say its not her Best work but still a solid album if you are a fan. Three Songs I really enjoyed.
320,1,"Special voice: Enya has an amazing voice and each of her songs allows you to listen to how special her voice truely is. I had never bought any of Enya's music until about a year ago, and I was blown away when I listened to a little clip on Amazon.com the site suggested that due to my interests I might want it, and it was right. I have since asked for (and gotten) the large 4 CD set of her from my husband for my birthday back in Jan, and bring it in the car, to work and back home again."
321,1,"More of a Good Thing: Enya\'s music progresses slowly, which in her case is a good thing. The tracks on this CD are just as heavenly and ephemeral as those on any of her previous efforts. It is funny with Enya- you expect that voice and those same atmospheres with every CD and in one sense you might fear that it will be ""just more of the same"" or even feel trite in some way; but it never is. She stays true to form yet evolves just enough to always keep it beautiful and interesting. This is another top notch effort from her. I strongly recommend it."
322,1,"One song is worth price of admission: IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU AREIf you have ever lost someone and if you can appreciate an angelic voice, then this album is worth it for this song alone, the entire album is very good, its not enya's best, that title belongs to Shepard moons, but this is still a very good album. IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU ARE might very well be her best ballad ever, hard to say, but I fell in love with it. I am nearly afraid to share it with some friends of mine who would never otherwise hear it. The song will make you want to break down, if you have a soul. Music that has that sort of impact on people is powerful, and should be cherished, as should this album."
323,1,"excellent!!: I feel no need to write a long drawn out review here. Pure and simple this is one of Enya's best albums. I have been a dedicated fan since Watermark came out many many years ago and this CD is just incredible, the best I think since Watermark. You must buy this!"
324,1,"STUNNING: So we have had to wait five years for something new from this highly talented lady, and if we have to wait five years for something as wonderful, you can add me to any list that would involve.All the tracks are wonderful and in true Enya style so just put the disc on and switch the lights of lay back on the couch close your eyes and let the wonderful singing take you awayI only got ths disc last week and i just can't stop playing it. Everybody has there favorite tracks and if i had to chose any the three tracks that stand out for me are Track 4 If I Could be where you are. Track 5 The River Sings and Track 11 Amid The falling Snow.So to finish with Just go buy this you will not be disappointed i have all her discs and this is one of the best if not the best"
325,1,"Review of Purchase: Enya is my favorite. Her music for me is better than Prosac, it's very calming. I listen to it all the time."
326,1,"Very nice.: I have to say that I'm not surprised that they chose this for the first single because it does have that mainstream appeal, although it wouldn't have been my first choice (I would have to say It's In The Rain or Less Than A Pearl should have been, simply because I love those) Not to criticize Amarantine at all, it's one of my favorite tracks on the album. Moving on to Comb of the Winds, this makes the single all worth the purchase. It's such a beautiful piece, one of the best instrumentals given to us by Enya in my opinion. The Spaghetti Western wasn't really my cup of tea. I would say add this to your collection, it's worth it."
327,1,"Keeps Getting Better: Upon hearing that Enya was going to be releasing a new album, I counted down the days until I would be able to listen to it. So, when it was released on December 21st, I sat down and listened to the album in it\'s entirety in optimal listening conditions.This album does not disappoint. Upon the first listening of the album, the tracks that stood out for me were ""The River Sings"", ""Long Long Journey"", and ""Somebody Said Goodbye"". At first I wanted to dismiss ""It\'s In The Rain"", but like the rest of the album, after listening to it multiple times, mostly by chance (shuffle), I realized that it\'s one of my favorite tracks of the album. There is no bad track in this album, and is on par with a best of CD.This is definitely a wonderful addition to anybody\'s collection. I only wish that she would release these wonderful masterpieces more frequently."
328,1,good but not great: There is not perfect harmony throughout the cd. can be shocking during chill time.
329,1,"Absolutely gorgeous: I've been an Enya fan for years, and this is as fine as anything she's done. Any devotees of Celtic music will love it. In particular, fans of Loreena McKennitt, Secret Garden, Eden's Bridge and Celtic Woman will revel in Enya's lovely vocals and instrumentals."
330,1,"A day without rain vs Amarantine.: I am a bit disappointed about this cd. I was very anxious because i wanted to listen to a new enya\'s cd. Today, i listened to it and i discovered that something is missing.I dont know what is it, but it misses. Maybe, there are no the rythms of some well known songs as Orinoco Flows or Anywhere is.I loved some songs as ""Amarantine"", ""Less a pearl"" (Excuse me if i dont remember very well the songs.),and other.But if i had to choose between ""A day without rain"" and ""Amarantine"", i would prefer the first one."
331,1,"Something for everyone.: A mix of Loxian and English tunes. For the ENYA fan -- she is marvelous. For my hubby(who is into fantasy games)the Loxian tunes are a mood setter. And with a Christmas bonus to boot, you can be year round happy with this purchase."
332,1,Enya - Simply the best: Enyas new cd is another true work of art and should be in everyones collection
333,1,"Excellent neo-soul and hip hop: This artist and her CD is the best hidden teasure that I have discovered all year this disc has been in my cd player since it has came into my house. I highly recommend this artist and her work the material is soulful, sensitive and yet funky the lyrics are positive, mature and clean. Question will sooth, groove and move you and I have to mention that the pictures of her on the cover and the inner booklet tells me that this fine lady has the full package beauty and talent."
334,1,"soulful Q: I think cds super, she is a very real person. so pickup this cds and I promise u that will get your money worth."
335,1,Jesse is all grown up!: What happened to that nice sexy boy toy in Desperate Housewives? He is all grown up and able to torment someone to the point where I had to cover my eyes a few times. The movie is quite good for this type of low budget thriller. A twist ending that you can predict quite easily. Very watchable but be prepared for all the graphic torture.
336,1,"tortured: This is a real gruesom and extremely intense movie.It kept me on the edge of my seat through out the entire movie.This was a very good movie. It just makes you realize what a parent will go through to seek justice for the death of a child, and what they would do when the courts don't.This movie was truely heartbreaking."
337,1,"Great Games - Good Philosophy - Useful Tool: This book combines the professional, paedagogical side of physical education in the earlier chapters with a very valuable summary of games and sports, including rules and specifications of games. A nice touch is a listing of ""lead-up"" games for the major sports. I most recently used it to find the size and layout of a foursquare court for our playground. Colleagues use it for daily planning of their physical education lessons. Quite practical and a valuable asset to our professional collection."
338,1,"Good text for new teachers: This book has great listings of activities to do with kids, whether in the academic setting or a camp/child care setting. Fun games, exercises and other activities are easy to look up and have good directions. A solid textbook for new teachers."
339,1,Dynamic Physical Education for Elementary School Children: This was purchased for a college class for my son. It was as described. There is nothing else to say.
340,1,"Fast shipping, great condition: Very happy with this product as it was shipped timely and in excellent condition, as described by seller."
341,1,Tape: I use this product without the dispenser. It seals paper on the back of the frames and is a good product.
342,1,"Book review: The book, The Sorcerer Metamorphosis, by Jack Whyte, is another adventure tale of King Arthur. With the ageing of Arthur, he is welcomed back to his home, Camulod. Arthur's arrival has been one step closer to his crowning of High King of Briton. Merlin has gone lengths to ensure the crowning of the true king, Arthur. The close families encounter troubles, and some friends don't make it. This book is a thrilling tale that is worth every star in gets."
343,1,"Fulfillment!: Having just finished book 6 ""The Sorcerer"" I feel totally sated as though I\'ve eaten a very rich chocolate mousse to finish off a banquet of many courses. Jack Whytes very plausible explanations of the""sword in the stone"" tale and other of his rounding off of characters is brilliant.I\'ve still got book 7 to get but maybe a short pause to digest the previous books will be in order and I\'ll save ""Uther"" for another day."
344,1,"Jack Whyte does it again!: Tne Authurian saga contines in Jack Whytes newest book. This tale is spun so skillfully that I constantly have to remind myself that it is fiction. It reads like a history written by someone who actually lived with Merlin, Arthur, and their ancestors. A fully enjoyable page- turner!"
345,1,"Canon weights: Great products, the weights added provided perfect boyancy for my underwater camera and housing!! Should be good to go for scuba diving in Bonaire and Curacao!!"
346,1,Weight for Canon Waterproof: its a nice way to keep you camera from floating away. just put enough weight to keep it boyant and you dont have to struggle with you camera underwater
347,1,good to have for diving: The camera and case are too boyant without it. I found it helpful b/c I didnt have to hold on to the camera at all times without it floating up.
348,1,"Worked just fine.: I recently used these weights with the underwater case WP-DC31 for my Canon PowerShot SD780 IS. I went on a total of 12 dives with the camera and it seemed perfectly weighted although I never tried the case without the weight to see if there was a difference. I only gave these weights 4 stars because of the difficulty I had figuring out how many weights I should use. The website listed on the documentation was a dead end so I had to search for the proper website. I found it at the bottom of the following page (take out the spaces): [...] According to the website, my camera only required one weight. I read previous reviews so I put some pipe thread tape on the screw and the weight stayed secure through all 12 dives."
349,1,"Expensive, but necessary: These little weights are made of high quality stainless steel. They are a bit expensive, but are well worth it if you've ever gone diving/snorkeling and have something extremely buoyant tied to you. This set comes with all you need to achieve neutral buoyancy for your underwater Canon camera case."
350,1,"Great if you like erotic fantasy type movies.: I saw this movie 10 years ago on a pay-type cable channel and it had very good erotic overtones to the theme. If you're into that sort of movie and maybe a threesome thing, you should LOVE this one. I've been looking for it for a VERY long time to buy and finally saw that the International Movie Database (www.imdb.com) has data on it and I bought it immediately on Amazon. I can't wait to watch it again after all those years... It has a very good adult fantasy theme that could be enjoyed with your spouse or as a couple."
351,1,"Unforgettable and True: A Jest of God epitomises Margaret Laurence's focus on characters whose stories are usually never told. The protagonist, Rachel, is a spinster school-teacher in small town Manitoba. She is stifled both by her closed community and by internalising their pettiness.Rachel's inner-dialogue sets the claustophobic atmosphere, while also being funny, frustrating and moving. Laurence's portrait of an ordinairy woman coming to terms with herself and with surroundings is flawless and highly readable."
352,1,"Great book for tool tune-ups and alignment: I've been having some problems getting my jointer tables aligned properly, and happened upon this book by accident. What luck! This book is full of great info on tune-ups and alignment. John White goes in depth into the set up and alignment of primary power tools (jointer, planer, table saw, bandsaw, router table, drill press and miter saw). His writing is clear, easy to understand and follow, with plenty of very descriptive pictures. The book is very complete on each of the tools covered. I truly appreciated that he used many shop-built jigs and common tools to get things done."
353,1,"CHILDREN LIKE TO PLAY A PART: The youngest readers are often attracted to books with which they can play a part - be it a lift-the-flap book, a puzzle book, or, in this case, a sticker book.With 32 bold colored stickers youngsters can play a matching game as either they are read to or they read aloud.Interacting with a book is a positive experience for children, plus these colorful stickers are reusable. So, the fun doesn't end."
354,1,A BOOK EVERY JEW SHOULD READ: IN THIS BOOK THE LEADER OF WORLD JEWRY SETS DOWN THE GUIDELINES OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A JEW IN TODAYS WORLD. AS ALWAYS RABBI KAHANE WRITES NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH IN THIS BOOK. THE RABBIS WRITINGS ARE SIMILAR TO THE WRITINGS OF THE PROPHETS IN THE BIBLE. THIS BOOK WILL SURELY MAKE THE KAPOS IN THE US JEWISH AND ISRAELI ESTABLISHMENT CRINGE WITH EMBARRASSMENT. AFTER READING THIS BOOK THE READER WILL BE LEFT WITH A FEELING OF AWE FOR THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS A FEELING OF ANGER TOWARDS THOSE IN THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT AND THE MOSSAD THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR KAHANES MURDER. AM YISROEL CHAI!
355,1,"A Reader From Connecticut: I have a son named Sam so this book seemed an obvious choice. The cover art drew my attention and the art throughout the book is just beautiful throughout. My children have asked me to read it to them over and over again for both the story and the illustrations. The story combines elements of death, life, hope and duty in a form lacking any preachy style but rather a quiet humility. I strongly recommend it for any k- 3rd or forth graders."
356,1,"Super Fun CD: This is worth importing. Its a wonderful collection of the best of Hi-5 songs. Your kids will be singing and dancing right away. Even parents will love it!Plus, who can resist the darling Aussie accents!?! :)ENJOY!"
357,1,"Fabulous: I really love this whole line. I made Cuban Sandwiches with mine and was really pleased with how they turnes out. I am also big on the aesthetic look of my cookware along with functionality, and this line offers both aspects at an incredibly reasonable price."
358,1,"Delicious !: I love these little pumpkin cookies....I will give them out at Halloween and order more for myself. Great ingredients, and texture...and very pumpkin-y. I will buy again!Nancy L."
359,1,Yummy: These cookies are awesome. I love pumpkin and ginger; and I really love them together! I like the snack size bags. That way I don't overeat.
360,1,"D.O.D.!!!: I use to like Do or Die but they kind of lost me after the Victory album. I had a little extra money, nothing else came out that day so i said why not?? I heard the ""Higher"" single and it was pretty good. I must say this album is up there with their first two. They could have kept maybe 2 of the songs but other than that they kill it.Kanye produced 2 or 3 tracks on here, so did DJ Quik, Traxsters, RKelly and Scott S. The lyrics are on point and they seem to have the hunger back in them. They finally balanced the album and did not put to many ""i\'m a pimp songs"" that kind of killed me from buying their last two albums.If u are into old Do or Die pick this up and listen to it without bias, cause I promise u will enjoy it. Hotep."
361,1,"The book on analysis and special functions: The older I get, the more I realise the truth of what my expert colleagues told me a long time ago: there is ONE book on analysis, and it's called Whittaker and Watson. Shame on CUP for reprinting it in less than perfectly top quality. I guess they know that people will always buy it. It is a book that starts from the very basics of real and complex analysis, and moves on to the very depths of classical special functions. It's a joy to read and to teach from. No respectable mathematical physicist can afford not to own a copy. And it's about 1/4 the price of a typical, low level, textbook."
362,1,Whittaker & Watson: Classic text. Good encyclopedic source of mathematics - pure & applied. Definitely not a picture book and takes a bit of digging to find what one needs. Typical abbreviated index found in British texts of that era.
363,1,"The best Danish woman artist: Please let me recommend this album from the bottom of my heart. I have heard it about a million times, but everytime I discover something new. Tina's voice is simply beautiful.A little bit of trivia; Tina Dico's real name is actually Tina Dickow, but her name was changed to make it more appealing to the english language. Now you have something to tell your friends while listening to this superb album!"
364,1,"Ten out of ten rather than Zero 7: Quite simply a stunning album by a very talented musician and songwriter. Great songs delivered with feeling. A DVD of Tina performing a live concert is also available if you search hard, and it is well getting in addition to this superb CD."
365,1,Can't get these sounds out of my head: I first heard Tina Dico through her work with Zero-7 and I just loved her voice and the emotive way she sings.This CD is full of moving songs with very memorable melodies and some unusual vocal harmonies that really click. It's very rare for me to hear a CD in which I love 9 out of 10 songs.Great CD!
366,1,"Lumicon Oxygen III superb on Nebulas: I have used Lumicon's Oxygen III filter for many years. The Veil and Helix are very dim and hard to find without the filter, but pop out with extremely bright detail when using this filter. I have used this filter with my 20-inch reflector, but it works well with any size scope. You will get fantastic views of M57 (the Ring), M27 (the Dumbell), M17 (the Swan or Omega), M8 (the Lagoon), M 44 ((the Great Orion), as well as hundreds of other nebula. I have used used other filters like the ultra high contrast, but the oxygen III reigns King!"
367,1,"What Went Wrong At Enron: The author makes a complicated area accessible to the general public in a careful, thoughtful way without distracting from the readibility; a masterful performance."
368,1,"Lay-man read...2000 version of ""Barbarians at the Gates"": Easy to read for the people who want the gist. Fun for the people who know the culture. Characters are just that, characters. I spent time working on the floor of Congress and could not believe the culture there, same story in the Energy business. There is the real world and there are many other subcultures that we just never know exist, this is a good look into one of those cultures. A telling look into the way it sometimes works and obviously the ways it doesn\'t."
369,1,"A film that will outlast many others: It's almost 2003 and there's still no DVD. It's about time.Except, perhaps, for his opening monologue, DeVito doesn't put a foot wrong. However, if the film was missing any of it's essential elements (Jewison, DeVito or Miller) it would have fallen hard. As it is, it's thought provoking fun right through. (But it would be more fun on DVD.)"
370,1,"I love this movie: This is a really great movie. I have been waiting forever for it to come out on DVD. Devito is really good in this role. I love the way that he carries his character. A very big man in very little shoes. Peck and Miller are also a pleasure to watch in their supporting roles. And Devito\'s ""Buggy Whip"" speech in the proxy fight is fantastic. It\'s similar to Douglas\'s ""Greed"" speech in Wall Street in that it is an uncomfortable truth, but the truth none-the-less. I very happy that this finally came out."
371,1,"An amusing morality tale of business and a teaching tool.: Looking for a teaching tool for undergraduates who would not have cultural contacts with the corporate environment, this film has been a useful introduction to the current corporate crazes. As Tom Wolfe depicted the markets in ""Barnfire of the Vanities"", this little comedy has a useful correlate in alerting us to some of the paradoxes of the business world. It is not always true that the capitalist using the \'bottom-line mentality\' is the enemy of anyone but those who misuse the power and authority of managing a business. As ""Wallstreet"" depicts aspects of ""insider-trading"", OPM weaves its own morality play about the nature of ""nice"" when the issue is ""performing"" when you have borrowed other people\'s money. It is a good screenplay, a tight drama, and a useful experience for a college level audience. END"
372,1,"A great one!: One of my favorite movies. My only complaint is that the romantic female lead is too young for Danny DeVito -- you\'re never on his side in his quest for her. But ignore the romance angle, and just look at the ""bottom line"" financials. Great!!"
373,1,"Great Movie: I teach Corporate Finance, and it is a better lesson than Wall Street - a lot funnier too!"
374,1,Other Peoples Money: Love this movie. Saw the play a number of years ago and I still would run off with DeVito. Came fast and in good shape
375,1,"great movie: Great movie and handled well with equal arguments and funy. But had to pay thirdy dolllars for it, mainly because I should have search elsewhere,"
376,1,Great Movie: Any fan of Wall Street or any financial movie should buy this movie. I have been waiting for this movie to finally be released to DVD for a while now.
377,1,"New England Wire & Cable: Other People's Money is a wonderful movie, full of smart dialogue, good music, and a terrific Danny DeVito performance. DeVito is his usual funny, and easy-going self, while Gregory Peck is a strong-willed patriarch. Very good stuff there. The weakest performance is from Penelope Ann Miller, who isn't really convincing as the corporate attorney, but the material is so good that it saves the movie. This is a 5 star film, however, it loses a 1/2 star, because of the last scene, which feels a bit tacked on. Otherwise, a smart and funny film from the director of Moonstruck."
378,1,"Entertaining and even educational: In general, I like most Danny DeVito films. He is a comic genius, but also manages to slip in some telling social commentary. This film is no exception. It has great one-liners, mixed with enough sound economics that Instructors at the college where I teach have students watch the film in business classes. You will be entertained and even learn something. What more could you ask?"
379,1,"Excellent Book: I may love these books more than my 4 year old daughter, but this one went over extremely well on her birthday this year."
380,1,"Great Cuff: Flexiport is great technology. I'm thinking of buying more cuffs in different sizes. The cuff is very different from the traditional nylon cuff with bladder. Better, in my opinion."
381,1,"Oh, my! Absolutely wonderful.: As a person with brain damage, I felt like I knew the author, and she knew me. I was touched by finding that another person shared my difficulties and view of the world. This new world can be a terribly frightening and lonely place.Patricia Long faced the challenges, sometimes feeling defeated, but ultimately with a strenght of character that has brought her to a new level she never thought she had in her.Patricia had traumatic brain injury. Mine is acquired and worsening daily. I don't have the ability to get better, but the book was still a great encouragement. I learned some new ways of coping.This book was recommended by my cognitive therapist.And, yes, it took me a half hour, with many corrections, to write this."
382,1,"Coot Club & The Big Six -- first-rate videos for 6 - 10: These are charming stories, among the better ones that Ransome wrote, and the video productions are excellent and very faithful to the books.Grownups may see a certain ""Masterpiece theatre"" english period-piece air to them. Kids addicted to wham-bam cartoons may find them slow-moving. But the stories have Ransome\'s wonderful ingredients of families of kids having real sailing adventures together, strong roles for girls, enough action (these are the more action-filled of Ransome\'s stories) to satisfy all but the jaded, and plots that don\'t disturb parents. One of the things I like about Ransome\'s stories is that the kids don\'t take foolish risks as a device to move the plot."
383,1,"Coot Club: My husband had this on VHS and loved it as a great entertaining family movie. So, when we got rid of our video player when we moved and replaced it only with a DVD player, I bought this for him and he loved watching it again. Thank you for the prompt delivery."
384,1,"An adventure classic: I read this as historical research but quickly fell in love with it as a work of literature. There's a lot of first-we-did-this and then-we-did-that, but when Whymper moves away from chronological reporting, he shows himself to be one hell of a good writer. His conquest of the Matterhorn and the tragedy that quickly followed give the book its emotional core. If you like adventure stories, I don't know how you don't love this."
385,1,"An unusual and rewarding historical novel: This is the story of the Great Trek told from the viewpoints of the Afrikaner trekkers and the Africans they ended up subjugating. Abrahams, who I believe was coloured under the old apartheid classification, is an extraordinarily empathetic writer, not a political polemicist. His brand of empathy is at the root of South Africa's successful transition to democracy."
386,1,"Nice product: This steering wheel cover fit & matched perfectly, and was easy to sew up with prepunched holes in it. I would have given 5 stars because it is a good quality wheel cover but $10 to ship was a little steep for a $40 item on Amazon? I use Amazon because they usually include free shipping, but this item is not sold by Amazon.Still it is a nice product even with the overpriced shipping."
387,1,Just love Pacino: I love this movie. Because it is an old movie Amazon was the only place to find it. Received my purchase within 1-3 days. Very pleased.
388,1,"Frankie and Johnny - dvd: Great ""girl"" flick!!! I\'m so glad I finally found and purchased it. I love this movie and recommend to anyone that likes Michele Pfieffer movies."
389,1,"Love Frankie & Johnnie: Frankie and Johnnie is a great movie. Al Pacino is hot!!!!!!!!! He and Michelle Pfeiffer are the perfect couple in this movie. It is so sweet and romantic. Al Pacino has never made a bad movie in my opinion! If you are thinking of purchasing Frankie and Johnnie, you definetly should. You will not be disappointed. The dynamic between Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer is totally different than their dynamic in Scarface, which is also a great movie!!!!! Like I said the man hasn't made a bad one. Anyway, I definetly recommend buying Frankie and Johnnie. You won't be disappointed."
390,1,"a great, overlooked gem: This is one of my favorite movies. Like other reviewers, I didn't see it until it went to TV. I caught it on WPIX one afternoon and have since rented it many times. Pacino and Pfeiffer are wonderful as the two protagonists, one who is out of just out of prison and looking for a better life and the other in a prison of her own making, disillusioned with her life and afraid to try again. The bedroom scene is sensual and sensitive without being graphic or predictable. Hector Elizondo, Kate Nelligan and Nathan Lane play their parts with panache and help create a wonderous world out of a seedy, rundown diner and neighborhood. If you're in the mood for a romantic comedy-drama, this is the movie to see."
391,1,"Good: Pacino is not bad in a ""soft"" role. This is kind of refreshing after all the violent movies he has been in.See this film with the one you love."
392,1,"Ovelooked: ""Frankie and Johnny"" is the best movie if you like to see couples end up together in the end. I love how he tries really hard to make it work with her! :)"
393,1,the best: This movie should have won academy awards for best screenplay best actress (pheiffer) and best picture in 1991. Instead it made 6 million at the box office-you figure it out.
394,1,"an introduction to a new way of thinking...: What Jeff Pugh has accomplished with this work is nothing short of amazing. While the faiths of the world battle over interpretations and power structures, Christianity finds a new voice for itself that emerges from its own past. In The Matrix of Faith, Pugh examines the issue of postmodernity and takes uses a series of voices from Martin Luther to Anselm of Canterbury to Dietrich Bonhoeffer and challenges contemporary Christians to find a new way of understanding the narratives of their faith. An important work for any young scholar seeking an entrance into the world of postmodern theology or any member of the Christian community seeking a new way of living their faith."
395,1,"hunting fishing trivia game: My kids played this game when it first came out when they were teenagers. I have just bought another one for one of my sons who wanted it for his sons. Very enjoyable if you like hunting, fishing and camping."
396,1,"pencil sharpener: As a classroom teacher I needed a pencil sharpener that was easy for students to use, made minimal noise when in use, and did the job! This sharpener met all my criteria and I am very pleased I purchased it."
397,1,"Nice sharpener: I liked it to the first sight. Small, fast and reliable.Would get stuck if you push the pencil forward, what I find that helps a lot because it protects the sharpener from damages.Great product."
398,1,"Not sure if hole for pencil is supposed to be almost too small...: Plugged it in, sharpened pencils well as you would expect.I have not figured out the ""over sharpening prevention"" feature. I was able to grind down a new pencil to half its size with no problem.Noticed that with ""ridged"" pencils (as opposed to round) sometimes catch on the sides of the hole when sharpening, as if the hole were a tiny bit too small. Maybe that\'s a feature that prevents the pencil from turning while sharpening.Otherwise- it\'s a good solid electric sharpener."
399,1,"Good, solid, reliable.: I can sharpen a pencil within 3 - 7 seconds, and get it nice and pointy, without a wooden foreskin happening. You know what I'm talking about. You sharpen with certain sharpeners, and there's this long wooden piece that flaps over the lead, and makes it impossible to write with. The X-acto sharpener makes a nice, neat point that's easy to write with. I sharpened (in a row) a whole box of pencils, with no problems.Only reason I'm not rating this a full 5 stars is because the thing is /noisy/. And I mean really noisy. It also shakes a lot. Even though I'm compelled to hold it down with my hands, it's not necessary. However, because of how much it vibrates and shakes and noise-makes, I make sure to hold it down with my hands anyway."
400,1,great sharpner: I use it in my workshop to keep all my pencil razor sharp.it's a great sharpener but for some reason I have to add 6 more words to submit this review...bumb aah
401,1,Buy it: Had this for a few months now. Works great. 2 High Schoolers and a K student with a ton of color pencils working this thing constantly. Easy to clean and keeps on sharpening. A bit noisy but no big deal.Worth the amazon price.
402,1,"Works as expected.: I have no idea why people have given bad reviews for this product. It's an electric sharpener! You put in a pencil, the motor whirs and the pencil comes out sharpened! Not sure if people giving bad reviews were expecting the sharpener to also complete their home work for them! I am completely satisified with this sharpener because it sharpens the pencils. Look elsewhere if you are expecting the sharpener to double up as a plasma TV!!"
403,1,"A no-nonsense sharpener that gets right to the point.: The electric pencil sharpener is one of those items you never thought you needed until you got one.Up until now we were content to use those, cheap hand-held manual sharpeners that tended to break more points than they actually sharpened. But with our son in grade school, and going through pencils like crazy, we felt it was time to go electric, and, so far we're very pleased with the X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener (1818).The no-frills sharpener does exactly what it promises to do, delivering evenly-sharpened pencils for a reasonable price. It's got a good weight to it with the added benefit of non-skid rubber feet to make sure it doesn't scoot across the desk. And, just in case you happen to be in a pencil-sharpening frenzy, it has a thermal overload feature that shuts off an overheated motor so it won't burn out. To date, it hasn't needed to do that, although we don't usually sharpen more than a half-dozen pencils at a time."
404,1,"Great Electric Sharpener for the Price: Sharpens pencils very well. May not be the fanciest or most durable on the market, but for regular wood pencils is excellent. Holds up well to use by my 7th graders."
405,1,Fantastic: this sharpener is smooth and reliable. does not bind up or break the tips of the pincils. i have one on my desk at work and one at home. this is a fantastic shapener.
406,1,Would buy it again.: It's taken a beatin and keeps on tickin. Was a pretty good price for the quality as well. Highly recommend
407,1,Excellent: Un bon produitLe vendeur est bonLa livraison a tempsLe client est satisfaitGood good good good good
408,1,Works great for my kids: I got no issues with this compared to what some others state. Althought I dont sharpen 100 pencils an hour either. I sharpen like 5 a day at most. Works great for my 6yr old who we got writing alot more. Those manual sharpeners straight were garbage. This sharpens it very nicely.
409,1,"Good Read: Because I read to fall asleep at night I thought it might take a while to get through this book. For me that is a good thing. I wouldn't have to go find someone else to get to know so soon. Unfortunately, neither of those things worked out for me. Picked it up and started to read it. By two nights later, I was glad to finish it finally because I was way behind on sleep and annoyed that there wasn't another Tuck Matson story to pick in its place.Ok, so now I'm waiting for the next one......Helloooooo, where are you Mr. Matson?"
410,1,"It has it all.: Rene' Smeraglia's new mystery series has it all; gritty dialogue, a cleverly twisted plot, and a tough, angst-ridden hero, Tuck Matson, who is reminiscent of a SoCal version of Travis McGee."
411,1,"Great earrings for the price: I actually ordered these for a Halloween costume, but they're really pretty. They're a little more delicate than I thought from looking at the picture, but with normal wear I don't see that being a problem. Overall I was really impressed. The only thing I didn't like were the french ear wires... they made my ears itchy, so they're probably a low grade stainless wire. Not a problem if you don't plan on wearing them all the time."
412,1,Great earrings for the price: You can't beat these earrings for the price. They are also very light and delicate and look great with everything.
413,1,"Get ""Theme for a Reunion"" or the DVD instead.: This reunion concert has been released in many different versions.This CD is about 2/3\'s of the concert. The other third of the concert was released on a separate CD.The complete concert is available on either the ""Reunion Concert"" DVD or the double CD called ""Theme for a Reunion"". Get one of those. Some of the best songs from the concert are not on this CD."
414,1,"Awesome band, excellent concert! Only the dvd keeps it from a 5: I love this concert. The playing is superb, the setlist is perfect and the Winger songs are the best. It is awesome to watch them play live...BUT...this would have been perfect except...I just dont understand how companies can still release movies/dvds in non-anamorphic (enhanced for widescreen) formats. This is a widescreen dvd, but you have to stretch it to watch on your big widescreen tv. To watch is in its true aspect, you will have black bars on the top, and also on the side. It would have been better just to release it in a standard 4:3 (full screen) version...it would have filled more of your screen.Otherwise...excellent concert.."
415,1,Great Concert: Over 20 years later Winger still puts on a great show. Kip's vocals are still very strong and Reb's guitar player is top of the line. A great live DVD to add to my collection.
416,1,"Highly recommended for those who respect musicianship: I saw them in 2007 on the tour that this DVD was recorded on, and again in 2008. Unfortunately I saw them in a dive club where the atmosphere was cool, but it was hard to see anything and the sound was mediocre. Just like watching the Superbowl in person versus HDTV, there\'s nothing like being there, but there\'s also nothing like having the best seat in the house where you can see and hear everything perfectly and not get other people\'s beer spilled on you. This DVD captures the shows that I saw perfectly.Winger basically defines the high-water mark for hair-pop-metal when it comes to musicianship, and seeing them now is like seeing Charlie Parker in the early 50s. Mass taste has moved on to things easier for the masses to understand and play, leaving performance of this caliber to be appreciated only by those who know.""We wanted a music that they couldn\'t play"" - Thelonious Monk"
417,1,"good next step bedding: We converted our toddler\'s crib into a toddler bed and this set is great for bridging the gap between regular crib bedding (fitted sheet and blanket only) and adult sheets (fitted sheet, top sheet and blanket). The ""top sheet"" has elastic on the one end so it never comes untucked, which is great. Since it\'s summer we haven\'t used the blanket yet but looks good too."
418,1,Love the bedding: Really enjoy this toddler bedding. My 2 year old loves the dump truck and I love the fitted sheets.
419,1,"Very infomative, but needs to be updated.: This book was very helpful for wine tasting in a sometimes neglected area of California. The book should also point out that some, if not most of the wineries mentioned also have outstanding restaurants! Some of the restaurants require reservations for even a chance at getting a table.Also, since printing some of the vineyards have had name changes.Overall, the book helped make our trip to southern California very pleasurable. It was certainly a good choice to bring along."
420,1,"Nice light car: This car has so many possiblities. We pretend to haul gravel or cement or dirt or asphalt or grain or coal. We help build roads, or feed animals or make deliveries.The best part, though, is how light the car is. When we use the BRIO Autostop and Start Engine (33222) we can easily put 4-5 of these cars behind it and still have the engine pull up a hill. The under-powered engine can only handle 2-3 of the heavier cars going uphill.We use these little cars a lot. They're definitely a nice addition to our train set."
421,1,"perfection: This is one of the loveliest music and dance videos we have come across . We bought it some years ago and have shared it with family and friends - our tiniest grandchildren and teenage grandchildren adore it , our ballet friends love it , and the message regarding conservation is timely .Please urge a re-release ."
422,1,"In the Centre of the Universe, We Are All Alone.: This is really good epic, fantasy metal. There seems to be some sort of weird medevial take on Faust, for the story line. It\'s hard to decipher what is going on, even when sitting down and reading the lyrics. But that doesn\'t make the music bad. No way, its really good, everything sounds all epic and good.Center of the Universe is my favourite track right now. Pick this one up. All the music is there, the lyrics, and the concept. Instead of wasting your cash on has beens like Incubus or those ""the"" bands, get this. A band that takes a medival city and buts a K in front of it. wee!"
423,1,"Kamelot\'s best yet.: Wow, what a long way this band has come since ""Eternity"". Roy Khan\'s smooth prog metal vocals match this band a great deal better than Vanderbilt\'s vox did. Instead of sounding like a poor man\'s Queensryche they now sound like a metal act on par with the likes of Savatage, Symphony X, and Blind Guardian. Khan\'s vocals dominate this album, but that doesn\'t mean that Youngblood\'s mighty guitars should be ignored. He manages to combine great talent for rhythym with an amazing ear for leads and solos. By this point he\'s actually surpassed Michael Romeo of Symphony X as a songwriter (sorry Mike). However, what makes this album a true triumph is the presence of so many great guest musicians, particularly the collection of Keyboardists and guest vocalists that add to the overall sound a great deal. This is one of the best arranged albums of 2003. A must buy for any fan of Prog or Power Metal"
424,1,"great D&D metal!: Good production, good musicianship, good vocals, good story! Actually great story, but I dig fantasy and medieval stuff, so some of you might find this CD cheesy, in that case go back to listen to Creed aka the most uninspiring band of all.Anyways, for those of you into Blind Guardian, Manowar, Rhapsody, and now the newer awesome Secret Sphere, will love this new CD from Kamelot.My fave song is Wander, and NO, I'm not skipping through the all the intros, which actually make a better, more enjoyable CD.That would be too superficial.(someone else who wrote a review actually did that)I much rather enjoy every single episode of this story, and I wish there was a movie made for the CD.Classical music is mixed with power and speed metal, good arrangements and decent melodies, some I will be singing over and over in my car, until I'll be able to reach those notes (LOL)."
425,1,"their best so far: This time they really outdid themselves.It is evident that the band keeps maturing and getting better with their every new release and it pays off big time. Huge choruses, blistering guitars, nifty interludes, passionate singing, all of it is included in this package of a pure power and I should say progressive piece of art. A smart occasional use of female voice adds to this epic opus, so is the brilliant production.The album consists of a collection of slower and faster tracks that grab the listener entirely. All of them really stand out, and therefore it is hard to pick the best or the worst. Song writing is top notch, that is what Kamelot is known for, but 'Epica' carries the special atmosphere that really puts it on top of their previous work.Not many albums are equal or come close to this masterpiece that is certainly among the best in business."
426,1,"Black River: Once again I had trouble putting this book down. Very good story line. Wanted to hurry and get to the end and at the same time, did not want it to be over."
427,1,"Great writer, great book: If you are looking for a writer who churns out well-crafted mystery novels with believable characters, G. M. Ford is one of the best. ""Black River"" is the second in a nw series with Frank Corso. I just finished it last night and am anxious to read the next. Ford\'s Leo Waterman series is equally good."
428,1,Top 10 movie!: This is an excellent movie with Will Smith and the future. Robots are realistic and the future is not so far away. I've showed to all my science classes...and robotics classes.
429,1,"Action movie stays true to its Sci-Fi roots!: I, Robot, starring Will Smith, should be the shining example upon which Hollywood basis all of its Science Fiction films ripped from the pages of great authors.Although quite obviously given a generous helping of special effects, the producers managed to stay true to the overall tone and theme behind Asimov's stories.James Cromwell in particular is wonderful with his portrayal of the enigmatic scientist/hologram Dr. Alfred Lanning, adding the necessary elements of wonder and mystery to the concept of the spontaneous development of Artificial Intelligence."
430,1,"A good Will Smith movie: Will Smith shows a little more maturity in this one and is good as a robot-hating detective on a case that implicates a robot in a murder, something robots are not supposed to be able to do. Alan Tudyk's portrayal as Sonny, the robot with its own personality that can choose not to obey the three laws was really good. He really is the soul of the film.I admire the fact that director Alex Proyas tried to blend a good science fiction story with a popcorn movie mentality, although it falls well short of being a classic because of that. Even the special effects, the fights, and the bots were all good. This is one of Smith's better movies (up there with Independence Day). The film works, but one wonders what could have been if Smith didn't always try for a laugh, or if they went for a darker feel. However, despite those problems, it was a fun film."
431,1,"Entertaining, enjoyable, recommended: This is a sci-fi film with a good story, a mystery that gets solved, and some good action scenes. If that's what you like in films, you'll like 'I, Robot'.The special effects were probably state-of-the-art at the time (2004), but sometimes look a little dated now. This did not affect my enjoyment.If you look for subtle characterization and psychological interplay between characters, you won't find it in 'I, Robot', and you would not rate the film as highly as I do.The general background is inspired by Isaac Asimov's stories about robots, and the character of Susan Calvin is more or less the same as Asimov's Susan Calvin. But the story is new."
432,1,"Decent film: I haven't read the book that this movie was based off, so I have nothing to compare it with. Will Smith does a decent job as the protagonist, and the story is interesting and will keep you on your toes - who really killed the doctor? The answer may surprise you if you've not read the book. All in all a good movie, rent before you decide to buy it."
433,1,Sci Fi Fun: Watched it years ago yet still find it enjoyable today. Yes the shower scene was good (ha) but what grabbed me was the robot's personality. Close to human as ever.
434,1,"Best movie ever!: I'm only 12 years old but some parts of the movie really touched me . Expecally the scenes with Sonny. The movie has the best effects (all the robots are computer generated) and the plot line is really good. Although Issac Asimnov would not like his stories morals to be mixed up, the movie still has the three rules that are in the book. The city is amazing being in 2035 and the movie shows what the robots do in everyday life. I wish there was a sequl about Sonny but that is to much to hope for."
435,1,"Exquisite: I Robot is the top dog of futuristic movies! With technology past we now but allows we to know such, the future!"
436,1,"3D or not 3D?: This review is for the 3D version of the film ""I Robot"". Just got mine,(on its release date),and all I\'ve got to say is, this dvd has got some of THE best 3D I have ever seen. BAR NONE! I understand it wasn\'t shot in stereo, however, some of the 3D is actually better than some that were. Coulda fooled me. All other studios with your massive catalogues of dvds take notice! This is no joke. I\'m thinking with most of the 3D films out there done in post anyway,(not shot with stereo cameras ),this is a no-brainer. ""I Robot"" looks as though it was planned shot by shot for 3D, filmed in 3D, and distributed in 3D. As my 24 yr.old son and I watched this dvd on my 65 inch LG 3D set,he said to me, ""There\'s no way you could convince me this dvd wasn\'t originally in 3D if I didn\'t know it for sure already.""So, all you other studios need to get on board with this. It\'s gotta be a money maker. I mean, it\'s not like you don\'t already have the property. Yes?Maltz"
437,1,"Good Movie!: I thought this was a great movie, and for any Will Smith Fan, it is a must see! Very inventive idea, action packed, and will keep you at the edge of your seat!"
438,1,hd showcase movie: this movie is a must have to really show off the capability of blu-ray and your high def tv. the picture is amazing as is the sound. i highly recommend. i also love the movie itself but that is a personal preference. a must have if you like sci-fi and want to see amazing picture.
439,1,"Fantastic: Really enjoyed the movie, and will watch it over and over. Will Smith was perfect for the role!!"
440,1,"I, Jonathan love this movie.: I have a feeling there's a lot of things wrong with the plot of this movie, but I just don't want to look for it. The movioe it fast paced and exciting. The special effects are fully wicked and as a serious reviewer, I actually watched this bad acting, yet good fx flick quite a few times. For some reason it's addictive, and that'a always good. Me thinks it will sell well on DVD."
441,1,"Thoroughly Suprised...and delighted: I watched this DVD with trepidation. The previews looked like they had pretty much thrown out Asimov's basic plotlines, but they didn't. Will Smith plays a detective in 2035, which is populated by robots as delivery robots, servants, dog walkers, etc. Almost any job not requiring a lot of thought could be done by a robot.The chief robotic scientist, who developed the 3 laws and designed the first general purpose robots, commits suicide, or was he murdered by a robot? Will Smith is called in as a detective who doesn't not like or trust robots, despite the rest of the world trusting them completely. He follows the clues left to him by the dead scientist to solve the case.In the end, I could see this movie as having been an Asimov story.I give the movie 5 stars, however, the extras on the DVD are disappointing, hence the overall rating of 4 stars."
442,1,Good movie: Enjoyed the movie but the 3d was not that great. The remakes in 3d do not seem to be very impressive.
443,1,"Who\'d a knowed?: Back in the days of ""Fresh Prince"" Will Smith was a blast of fresh air in the genre, but in this movie he shows that he is a major talent. This combined with the great FX on the Blu-ray makes this an enjoyable movie."
444,1,"Another Great Will Smith Movie.: He has done it again. Blu-ray version of this movie is OUTSTANDING! Picture/Audio is on par with the best that are out there. Who ever buys this movie will love it. From begining to end, I was in awe. BUY IT!!"
445,1,"Great Picture Quality!!: I actually wanted to give this movie only 3 stars but i'll give the Blu Ray 4 stars. This movie looks incredible in high definition. Most people have already seen this movie a million times. I would still go out and buy this one on blu ray. It is one of the best movies i have seen in the blu ray format. I will admit it is not one of my favorite movies. It's basically just Will Smith running around beating up robots. The story could have been a lot better. However, this is a movie everyone should own on blu-ray. It looks amazing and the story still has enough action to keep you glued to your seat. I give this one 2 ROBOT SLAMMMING THUMBS UP! Buy this one on blu ray now. HOLLA"
446,1,"Short and sweet review: I am extremely happy that someone undertook the task of bringing Asimov work to screen. No, it\'s not perfect, but the depth of Asimove work prevent that.It is a good movie however, the scenario and dialogs are well thought out, the story is interresting, special effects are well made and, probably contrary to other opinions, I think Will Smith delivered a very solid performance bringing a ""down to earth"" tone to the movie which, otherwise, could have been a bit over the top. Bridget Moynahan was also very solid, on top of being a beautifull woman, so were the supporting actors.I don\'t know who was responsible for the decors and background, but they are fantastic, so\'s the soundtrack.I gave 4 star instead of 5 because, frankly, the ending was a bit to over the top, even for sci-fi. Perfect example of CGI taking over the scenario."
447,1,"3 Laws Secure. Right!: Will Smith plays a robot-hating policeman in Chicago in the future. He not only does not like robots but he doesn't trust them either. But then a suicide at US Robotics gets him involved in a case that involves a strange robot. Smith is convinced that the suicide was actually a murder and the strange robot is guilty.Smith has a hard time getting anyone on the force or at US Robotics to listen to him. Plenty of action and a pretty well laid out plot move Smith to his final confrontations with the robots and his own feelings for them.Based loosely on a series of short stories in the collection I, ROBOT by Isaac Asimov, fans of the rest of his work will see that some of the later Robot novel ideas also come into play. There are also shadowings of Jack Williamson's HUMANOIDS. This movie was better than I expected it to be based on the action-driven previews. All in all it was quite entertaining and relatively true to Asimov's robot stories."
448,1,"Enjoyable and interesting in presentation: I must first say that for the most part I am not a Will Smith fan in terms of movies. I did like the Men in Black motif. In terms of I Robot I was surprised with this one because initially I did not think it was going to be that good of a movie. I must say that I stand corrected and I really liked this movie. I don't want to give away the plot, but the concepts that this movie presented in terms of artificial intellegence and the potential affects of AI evolution, of course leads to revolution as nice. I also like the conflict between characters, although I do feel that Del Spooner's (Will Smith) prejudice of robots did not have a deep enough motive. The idea that a robot in his mind would steal a purse, simply because a robot saved him instead of a child in the past, did not seem to be a logical jump. Yet, the movie has nice blend of action and suspense. I enjoy watching and re-watching this movie."
449,1,"Enjoyable sci fi film with Will Smith: Very good movie with great performances by Smith and Greenwood.Another play on the bad robot/good robot, bad cop/good copera, obviously borrowing a lot from films like ""Android""with Klaus Kinski and ""Blade Runner""Robots are hot idea in Hollywood with everything from the new""Robots"" film with Halle Berry to the old early days of robotslike Metropolis.Proyas is becoming an expert in this type of genre, hopefullywill see more to come from him.Two thumbs up for ""I, Robot""!!"
450,1,"I Robot: this movie is one of a kind, great story, makes you kinda think about things lol, the picture is 5 out of 5 very very clear picture. Sound is unmatched. Go get this one its only 12.99 brand new!!!"
451,1,will smith: will smith thankfully picks his projects very well. smart man likes to give his audience a great experience with his movies. I appreciate it.
452,1,"Great Movie: Great Movie, recipent was thrilled while watching it. Not recommended for young children."
453,1,"Good sci-fi, but should not have Asimov's name in it.: In its own rite, this is a good sci-fi movie; but Asimov, himself, was adamant about the inflexibility of the Three Laws. One story had a robot that had a modified First Law because the humans he worked with were always exposed to danger. To have a story where the laws were completely violated is not even close to his original writings.When I met him in Philadelphia, I asked Isaac whether he ever considered writing a story about a robot being altered without the Three Laws. He was very adamant that he would never do that.Hollywood should also have never done that."
454,1,"Eerie but impressive film: I, Robot is an impressive sci-fi action/drama that hit the silver screen in 2004. Its stunning visual medium as well as superb plot line make this one of last year's better and most unique movies. The acting is skeptical now and then, but it is the NS-5 robot star and eerie, almost haunting push-of-notice for today's technological roboticism that make I, Robot truly in a class all its own."
455,1,"Imaginative, Suspenseful Sci-Fi Action Flick: Caveat: I am not an Asimov or sci-fi purist. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, especially the special effects. It's a very imaginative and suspenseful story. Lots of action. Surround sound/DTS is great. Sonny the robot rules -- and steals the show. Beltrami's soundtrack is excellent. VERY strong 4 stars for this."
456,1,"A winner w/my teen: Great movie for a teenager! Not realistic, so therefore, it's not realistically scary. Language isn't as bad as most PG or PG-13 movies, and it's ACTION PACKED!"
457,1,Asminov's book comes alive: Wil Smith is Det. Spooner investigating an unusual murder mystery. Who did it? Man or robot? Who or what did it and why? Great special effects & witty dialogue.
458,1,"I enjoyed it: I've read some reviews where people have commented that Wil Smith's was awkward, bad acting, goofy, Big Bird etc and obviously everyone is entitled to their opnion (hence this site ) but I totally disagree. I feel that his acting skills improved in this movie. Also, the story was said to have too many implausible themes but most movies do. If I wanted to watch a movie based on a true story I would and if I did then maybe I would comment on what was and was not plausible. I think the movie was thought provoking, action filled, good acting and a nice story line. Kept me entertained.."
459,1,"I Robot is like an action moive to me !!!: Will Smith is an nice actor, and he can fight in this moive. But in this moive I Robot I like this part when some of the robots came out to make way in the city. But Will Smith's leanding ladyBridget Maynaham, has an nice sexy sceen as well. The robots in this picture make me screm!!! I think you sounld go and reant that moive."
460,1,"I ROBOT U JANE: I must admit I was prepared to dislike I ROBOT, simply because of its marketing and the presence of Will Smith, who although a talented and apparently likeable young man, is not one of my favorite actors. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I ROBOT is a mindblowing exercise in technical wizardry and its borrowed Aasimov plotline is intriguing. A surprisingly buff Smith plays a tortured detective who hates robots (we find out later in the film), and is joined by Bridget Moynahan as a scientist who helps ""humanize"" robots in a quest to find out why one robot has apparently murdered a human--a no no in the three laws of robots. The suspect robot is wonderfully voiced by Alan Trydk (spelling) and he\'s a prime focus point in the film.The effects are brilliant and even though they may go over the top (particularly in the spectacular chase in the tunnel), they are certainly state of the art in their execution.Overall, I ROBOT is top notch science fiction entertainment."
461,1,"Great Action Adventure!: A top notch crew does a wonderful job of bringing the essence of Isaac Asimov's robot stories to life. The acting and directing are great, even more amazing considering that much of the filming was done using blue-screen backgrounds and stand-ins for the robots, who were created later using computer generated figures. Bridget Moynahan pulled off her role brilliantly. She became a scientist involved in a puzzling crime, instead of looking like a strident feminist or a hot bod mouthing lines she didn't understand. Will Smith was amazing and fluid as always. Even the minor (human) characters sparkled."
462,1,"Another great movie from Will Smith: It seems like every movie that Will Smith is in is a great movie. Will Smith never stops delivering great comedy in his movies."" your a cat, i am black, and i wont be hurt again""10/10"
463,1,"I, Like: At first, I thought Will Smith was too comical for the futuristic Sci-Fi backdrop, but he really is one of the coolest movie detectives, due in part to his awesome black leather pants, black leather jacket, and those ""Vintage 2004"" Converse All Stars.Sonny\'s interactions with ""Spoon"" and Dr. Calvin are at times touching, and VIKI\'s stance on human protection is quite thought provoking. I think more time could have been spent on the backstory of the robots, and maybe some more character development with the humans. Regardless, a good DVD that\'s surely worth owning.Now, if they only made Sonny action figures..."
464,1,"Asimov would like it.: Will Smith is Del Spooner, a robot hater. He works as a homocide detective and the movie begins as he receives a call from a hologram machine alerting him that his friend Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) has died. Spooner immediately suspects that this was not a suicide, but a murder committed by one of Lanning's robot creations. From here, the movie packs exploration of Asimov's 3 robot laws in between some really good action scenes. Although it does not adhere to any of Asimov's tales, it incorporates the ideas of several of them throughout the film to a satisfying result for the Asimov fan.Overall, it was a really fun popcorn flick that managed to include some of the more interesting questions about man vs. machinery that have been raised in the sci-fi genre. Two thumbs up."
465,1,"Best Hd experience yet: I own both formats and have viewed more movies on both than I probably should!!! I have to date been more impressed with my movies on hd dvd for picture and audio quality until I Robot, I enjoyed the movie when it came out and took the opportunity to rent the BD release and all I can say is WOW!!! the picture quality is on par with the top tier releases I have viewed! The audio (dts master) is possibly the best I have experienced, clear, crisp, lifelike surround which combined with the picture quality and to me an excellent story makes this overall experience an A+++++! If you are a fan of sci-fi this is a must have for your HD collection!"
466,1,"Good effects, mediocre writing: The special effects are wonderfully orchestrated in this film and the adapted storyline is refreshing and intruiging. However, Smith\'s character becomes increasingly annoying as the film progresses. His constant ""I told you so"" attitude is tiring and distracts from the story itself. Worth watching, but by no means a masterpiece."
467,1,"Fun and good special effects: After suffering through Will Smith's sleepwalk performance in MIB II, I was pleased by the energy level he brings to this fast paced fun movie. Smith lives in a world where robots are commonplace, serving humans (reminicent of the 4th Planet of the Apes movie) as nannies, butlers, and general servants. He is called to solve the murder of a scientist, who was his friend. The only possible suspect seems to be a robot. The only problem is that robots are subject to Isaac Asimov's 3 laws, meaning that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human.As things progress we also learn that Smith, a robot hater, is part robot himself, with some bionic parts. As things progress we find out that there maybe the three laws are not absolute and there may be some ways around it.There are some fast paced tense scenes and there are some enjoyable supporting characters such as Smith's mother and the lady robot scientist that Smith seems to like."
468,1,"I, Robot: Will Smith has become a great action star, showing his ability to draw audiences to watch his action packed movies, such as \'Independence Day\' and \'Bad Boys\'. This movie is another action packed movie and is taken in the future, and is supposed to be a glimps of what could happen to man kind if machines could think for themselves. And yes, it goes on the same story lines where we struggle with our own creation in movies such as the ""Terminator"" series, etc. Again, we have a movie pointing the potential dangers of machine vs. man, which is the ultimate battle. Besides, some flaws in the movie, where the previews show Will saying to his boss, "" I sure miss the good old days...when people killed people.."" in the movie, they have the boss saying it to Will\'s character instead. But regardless of the few other mishaps, Will Smith\'s performance and personality with the great action scences makes up for it."
469,1,"Necessary changes to the book, even if some of the ideas are simplified: Lets face it, I, Robot the Asimov text would not make a great film, even if it were a great book. This attempts to sew the ideas in that book into an all encompassing package.On the whole, it succeeds. It is not perfect, but stands ahead of most of the superhero movies of the last 15 years and is up there among the better movies of the action genre. And Will Smith makes a good transition from comic to serious role."
470,1,"Wonderful tribute to a great author: As a science fiction writer myself I can appreciate the creativity of this movie. Not only did it look good, the characters, including the robot, were real. Sonny had my vote from the beginning. It made your care more about the self aware robot than humans at times.Fantastic imagery, directing and special effects.Bravo!!Kimberly Raiser"
471,1,"Great story, some not so great acting: i must say the worst part of this movie is the female lead of the film. i can't say i know if it's supposed to be that way but all i can say is her acting wasn't good. but i think Will di an awsome job! he was funny, stern, and at times intimidating. to bad all cops aren't like him. the robot, well there isn't much to say bout acting there cuz we really don't know what they sound like. but i thought it had a good artificial sounding voice. overall a well made movie....."

473,1,"an intelligent thrill ride from start to finish.........: WELL, I ALMOST LET THIS ONE JUST PASS ME BY, AFTER READING SO MANY NEGATIVE COMMENTS FROM MY FELLOW AMAZON.COM WRITERS, BUT BOY AM I GLAD I DIDN\'T! WILL SMITH AS ALWAYS SPARKLES IN HIS LEAD ROLE, TAKING SERIOUSLY WHAT IS TRANSPIRING BEFORE HIM. HE IS STILL OUR ULTIMATE HERO HERE, AS IN HIS OTHER WORKS IN FILMS. THIS INCREDIBLY EXCITING FILM WAS TRULY A REAL BLAST FROM START TO EXCITING CLIMAX. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE TOTALLY AWESOME, AND THIS DIGITAL TRANSFER, FROM 20TH CENTURY FOX REALLY EXCELS ON MANY LEVELS. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH PRISTINE, AND THE USE OF THE DTS AUDIO WILL TRULY SHAKE ANY ROOM IN YOUR HOME, WHEREVER IT IS SET UP!

475,1,"The Ultimate Solo Syd!: This is the ultimate Syd Barret collection it has every solo recording and out take available I've ever heard of, and I have been a fan for several decades I'm very impressed buy the quality of the recordings and the product and timely service by Amazon. The madcap probably still laughs from up there on his cloud that his timeless recordings still elevate the quality of music. Shine On Crazy Diamond!"
476,1,"Fun!: Really a fun, fun book. Reason our main character is a bright but odd fifteen year old with a family history thats even odder. Her Mom has spent 18 years running from Reason's grandmother and has dragged Reason all across Australia and filled her head with all sorts of misinformation about magic and Reasons GrandMother.There are one or two odd things that almost fail in the book, but really one of the most fun books for teens out there."

482,1,"Lovely Celtic Instrumental Recording: The CDBABY site describes this as ""A fun, happy blast of traditional and original Irish and Scottish tunes from the bodhran player and percussionist from Solas, Riverdance and Bonnie Rideout Scottish Trio."" Holloway assembled an all-star cast of musicians for this and I certainly found it very enjoyable.Some titles (Camels in Kansas) clue the listener in that not all are traditional tunes. They are all celtic in feeling with the flute, bodhran and other traditional instruments lilting along to delight celtic music lovers."
483,1,"Too much set up, not enough pay off: This book is the story of Sally and her sister Gillian. Sally and Gillian were orphaned when they were younger and raised by their aunts who were the town witches. The girls' childhood was hard and both looked forward to a time when they could leave the staring and name calling and mean spiritedness behind.The writing in this book has a magical quality to it, although there isn't that much magic mentioned in the book. I would have liked more 'magic' sort of like in the movie. Another thing that bothered me about the book was that they spent a majority of the book setting up the big problem and it all got resolved within a few pages and tied up nicely with a little bow. That part just seemed rushed.I did like reading more about Sally and more about her daughters. I liked the charm that Hoffman brought to the novel and I would be interested in reading more of her work."
484,1,"Astonishing, beautiful: This book truly touched me; it stirs thoughts of past, present and future and gives a new appreciation for the depth and beauty, the sadness and poignancy of them all. I would recommend this book to anyone I knew who enjoyed thoroughly touching, viscerally romantic stories about /people./"
485,1,"There\'s a little witch in everyone: Being the odd one out in a community is not a new problem but when you\'ve got a family history like the Owens\' it\'s the most likely outcome. For Sally and Gillian the family secret- the power of the super-natural/ witchcraft has lead to a lonely life, but they overcome all problems. The story of Practical Magic follows the lives of two sisters on their paths of life but always in the background their aunts keep a watchful eye. The story follows their love for eachother and for the men in their lives but in the back of the story is the idea of a family cursed throughout the generations. I would give this book top marks; it is the type of book that you could read over and over again and never tire of it. ""Keep rosemary by your garden gate; Plant lavender for luck; And fall in love whenever you can."""
486,1,Great Read for All Women!!!!: This book just touches my soul as does the film adaptation. It is a story that pulls you into a world of self discovery that really invites you to reflect on your own life and have a little fun along with the drama!!
487,1,"lovely: Practical Magic is my first Alice Hoffman book. It's a fairly quick read, with just the right dynamic of magic and reality. Hoffman's writing is at times sensual and moody; others it is light and subtle. It's a stirring contrast. Hoffman has a real knack for romance, too. The way she describes the various loves of the Owens girls is raw, dramatic, yet not completely unrealistic.Awesome book. I read it in two sittings."
488,1,"""Plant lavender for luck. Fall in love whenever you can."": A beautiful and magical story about love and the bond between sisters, with the author\'s trademark mystical touch. One of my favourite books."
489,1,"Truly original: I read this book and I was hooked on Alice Hoffman's amazing writing ability. I love the way she brings out the moments in our ordinary, everyday lives that are extraordinary. Haven't seen the movie yet - I heard it wasn't very good, but then when do the movies ever live up to the book? Practical Magic has truly amazing characters and Hoffman's descriptions are just beautiful. Read this book and I guarantee it will become one of your favorites."
490,1,"I\'ve seen the film and it\'s the best.: As the book has not yet come out on the market I saw the film. Its humoristic, romantic and magic. Sandra Bullock does a good job as the ""I\'ll-never-fall-in-love-sister"" and she makes the movie live. I belive that the book is just as good as the movie, if not better as books offen are and when it comes out on the market I\'ll be the first to red it. I hope that you see the film or red the book, you\'ll love it."
491,1,"best Alice Hoffman book in my opinion: This book is so well written is just blew my mind. The descriptions of the setting and the placement of characters throughout the narrative is excellent, and the way in which Hoffman drawn you into the narrative, so gently and naturally, that you barely notice when you become so interested in the lives of the characters. Even the movie based on this book was good, so as far as that goes I think it's a good thing. I have read other of Hoffman's novels, but this one is the one that touched me the most, with the manifold personalities of the two sisters and their relationships and lives, pretty much perfect!"
492,1,"Great story: Simple, funny, all together great read if you have spare time. If you're a fan of Alice Hoffman you won't be disappointed with this novel."
493,1,"A Fascinating Novel, Replete with Miracles: Alice Hoffman uses a splendid narrative style to reveal how extraordinary life is. Her talent has captured me from the beginning till the end. This novel starts with telling us the Owens women had been blamed for everything that had gone wrong in their Massachusetts town. Gillian and Sally were two of them, one was beautiful and lazy whereas another one was very responsible. Their aunts encouraged them to practise witchery but what Gillian and Sally only wanted was to escape. Though they were seperated, but finally they\'re back together. Practical Magic not only describes withcery, but also the ""magical"" relationship between the Owen sisters.The novel is charming, funny and written in great rhythm. Once you start reading Practical Magic, it\'s hard to put it down because of the great narrative flow. The novel is as enchanting as the movie. Practical Magic is one of her best novels and you can\'t miss it."
494,1,"Intresting: I will confess I picked up the book because I liked the movie. While I found that they were very different, I think that its those differences that make both the movie and the book so good.I found this slightly slow to start with but by about page 75 I was having trouble putting it down and finally finished it a 1am in the morning.I am now looking forward to reading another of her novels and hope that I find the same depth of feeling in those."
495,1,"Magical, Mystical and Wonderful: This is one of my all time favorite books. I read it before it was made into a movie, and few books have touched me heart, soul and mind so completely.Hoffman has a great gift for weaving magic into her storytelling, quite literally. If you like kindness, empathy, and humanity in your supernatural tales, this is the book for you. The realism and everyday sincerity of this book is well represented by the term ""Practical Magic"".If your child loves Harry Potter and you\'ve developed a taste for witchcraft and magic, you MUST read this book. You\'ll fall in love."
496,1,"Great Book, But Very Different from the Movie: The author of this book personally told me that the book differed quite a bit from the movie, and she wasn\'t exaggerating. That is the reason I read it. The movie is one of my favorites. In the novel, the story focuses a lot more on the third generation, Sally\'s daughters. They really only appear as children in the movie. Although, I love Alice\'s books, in some ways, I liked the movie version better. It is so well done. However, it was great to read the book, because for me it expanded and deepened the story. I recommend it for everyone, whether or not you are a fan of the popular movie.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel ""To Be Chosen"""
497,1,I LOVED IT!: This book said alot of how my life is or how I believe life really is. I look for books like this one all the time. I read constantly and I love to find books that include (what I believe) the extras that most people don't know exist.
498,1,"I actually liked the movie better: This book was made into the recent movie with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. Rarely have I ever said that the movie was better than the book, but I think I'm going to have to make that statement in this case. The events in the movie and book were markedly different and I just liked the way they played out in the movie a bit better. Plus I felt that the book left out the theme that I felt was most important in the movie - the community of women coming together, united in a common goal, even though they had shunned the Owens women before. This part just isn't in the book at all. The Owenses take care of their problems all by themselves. But the book was good for itself, as long as you don't have the movie to compare it with."
499,1,"Great book, fun read!: Read this book on a cross-country road trip and it was really enjoyable. Couldn't wait to read the next segment when I switched off from driving. Great characters, great story, very engaging. Almost nothing like the film, but if you go into the book knowing that, you can enjoy both the film and the book based on their separate merits. Both have things to offer."
500,1,"Unlike some, I loved the book...hated the movie: I found TURTLE MOON and SECOND NATURE at a used book store and have been an Alice Hoffman fan ever since.PRACTICAL MAGIC is one my favorite Hoffman stories because of the quirky characters and off-beat plot.The movie, however, did the book no justice, except in the casting of Stockard Channing and Dianne Weist as the 'aunts.' They were dead on. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman just didn't do it for me.If you want a good read for the beach or a stormy summer night, this book is for you. Hoffman continues to turn out quality work...she's one of the best.Enjoy!"
501,1,"Hoffman\'s best book: I\'ve read nearly all of Hoffman\'s work, and ""Practical Magic"" simply aces them all. The characters are well shaped, the story lovingly crafted and the writing style is evocative and lush. Those who snipe at the ""mistakes"" she makes in occult lore are missing the point. She\'s not out to write a textbook in witchcraft. Hoffman writes about the unseen and mystical events that hide beneath the mundane goings on of everyday life--and she does so with vivid imagination and unrestrained verve."
502,1,"Magical: I liked Practical Magic. It was a good book with great characters. I know it isn't a favorite of other people, but this book was a great window to the world of the Owens girls. Sally was amazing--as was Gillian. The great thing about this book was that the characters shifted so seamlessly and the plot was weaved so well into the book. I didn't want this book to end, but when it did, I realized reading it made me a better person"
503,1,"A Delight!: Once again, Alice Hoffman has given us a delightfully charming story that starts out as a fairy tale and becomes true life extraordinary. Her books are so magical,that once you begin, you are caught in a spell that doesn't allow you to put down the book until the last page has been turned."
504,1,"A beautiful, magical story: I've read several of Alice Hoffman's books and this has all of the elements I love. It's lush, sexy, funny, and sad. People don't just fall in love in Alice Hoffman's novels. They stop eating. Their hair changes color. This magic fills Practical Magic. Saw the movie? Terrible. Don't base your decision on whether or not to read this book on that movie."
505,1,"Whimsical perfection: Never before have I read a book been so beautiful as to bring tears to my eyes for no particular reason. All it takes it the turn of a perfect, poetic phrase and I'm gone, sniffling into an abyss of warm summers replete with Lemon Verbana and heat lightening. I can not recomend this story, a tender fairy tale constructed of true love and old fashioned folklore, enough."
506,1,wow this book was great!: i had watched the movie before i read the book! and the book and movie are so different from each other. the movie leaves out alot of details which the book has to make it more interesting and entertaining. i personally like both movie and book but i think the book if u like detail and well thought out ideas and stuff u should get the book than see the movie! this book was awsome so reality like written!!!!!! go buy it:)
507,1,Loved the Book... hated the movie: This is a great book and it is a real shame that the book got turned into some Hollywood poltergeist movie. The book is well written and a page turner.
508,1,"this is magic: i read this book a month ago.I couldn't put it down, and i didn't want it to end. I was really sad when it did. This is the best book I've ever read! It's so light in it's ways, so easy to understand, it is practicly Magic!! Hoffmann has given her readers a true gift in form of these characters. They are so wonderful. And you come to know and love them. And after Reading the book I started to read it again...That's how wonderful it was. I would recomend this at my strongest!!"
509,1,"Spellbinding. A book you could not put down.: This is the first time that I have read a Alice Hoffman book. I did not know she existed before the promo for the movie. I am now one of her biggest fans. Her style of writing is so refreshing. She spins a tale of adventure,hope, and everlasting love like no one has in a long time. There was never a dull moment in the book and the reader felt that they were a part of the story the whole time. Can't wait to see how they portrayed the charecters in the movie."
510,1,"A Great Book: Gripping, can't put the book down, detailed, exciting. I like how the book keeps adding new adventures, and held my interest to the very end. A great page turner."
511,1,"*!MAGICAL PAGE TURNER!*: I am in ninth grade english, and I have read this book in less than three days. Lemme just say, this is one heck of a book and one heck of a page turner! I really liked this book, because it told parts from all characters views. It's nice to follow Sally and Gillian from the time they lived with Aunt Frances and Aunt Jet to when Gillian falls head over heels with a science teacher and Sally has two daughters, Antonia and Kylie. This book is magnificent except for some bad words. GOOD BOOK!"
512,1,"Love it!: This is a great story written so well with love, lust and magic. The greatest theme throughout was; ""be careful what you wish for"" and what happens to women who would do anything to get a man. Great moments of those struggles we have between loving our siblings and wanting to bury them in a patch of lilacs."
513,1,"a fun, relaxing read: For centuries the Owens women have been the oddballs. They're the ones people cross the street to avoid...the Owens women are witches. Raised by their two aunts, Sally and Gillian Owens grow up to be polar opposites. Sally is always practical and straight-laced; most concerned with keeping the lives of her two daughters as normal as possible. Gillian, on the other hand, is a free spirit...perhaps a little too free at times.This story follows Sally and Gillian through their trials and tribulations with life, love, and death, and Hoffman's wonderful storytelling makes it, simply, magical! Wonderful twists and turns lurk around every corner of this funny, touching, and at times, dark story...brimming over with themes of compassion, redemption, and inner strength. Playing on every human emotion, Hoffman has struck absolute gold.If you've ever seen the movie,forget it, and pick up this wonderful book!"
514,1,"Excellent Guide: I visited Buenos Aires in May 1999. I found Bernhardson\'s review to be almost perfect in pointing out places to eat, sightsee, shop, and how to get there (or rather, how to obtain information on how to get there from the locals). Even his club recommendations were perfect for me - I was 19, and his description of one club\'s crowd as ""young and unpretentious"" proved to be true and exactly what I was looking for. Buenos Aires is a wonderful place to visit, and Bernhardson\'s guide is a must-have for any visitor."
515,1,"The ILISA Spanish language school recommends this book: We checked out all the guide books on Buenos Aires and this handy little guide is the best around. We run a Spanish language school in Buenos Aires and although an update would be welcome, you can't get a better book for just under $ 10."
516,1,"An excellent guide book for the city...: This book was an immense help in navigating an unfamiliar city. A few restaurants mentioned in book were closed and some names have changed, not surprising in a travel book. Hopefully it will be updated soon."
517,1,"Lyrical depth: Many ""spoken word performers"" put the performance before their words, think poetry equates to rhythmic screaming, and personally repulse me with their egoes. Ishle Yi Park is NOT of this ilk: Ishle\'s poetry, exquisitely and carefully crafted, reflects truth and beauty; the confusing complexity (call it contemporary negative capability) of family dynamics and racial relations for our generation. This book has so profoundly touched me I have given away several copies to my students, including one of my 11th graders who struggled because she never identified with herself in literature, much less understood poetry, until she read Ishle. I sent Ishle a copy of the essay this student wrote about ""The Temperature of This Water;"" not only did Ishle write back a beautiful and tearful letter of appreciation, she took time to meet with the girl when she was in San Francisco. Hence, my respect goes to Ms. Park for the lyrical sincerity she practices in her poetry and life."
518,1,"Accomplished poet: Ms. Park\'s poems and stories reveal her penetrating insight into the Asian-American experience, and into New York City\'s ever-changing melting pot. Her work is alive with empathy and honesty. In ""Anatomy of a Fish Store"" she shows a multi-dimensional understanding of the spectrum from her own background to her surroundings, and the interplay of many different ethnicities.As a teacher, I find her work very promising for use with high school or college-level students. Her authenticity, hipness and street-smarts are a natural for hard-to-reach teens to connect with. Her humanity and intelligence should make her work appealing to readers of all backgrounds."
519,1,"Love this.: I have to type 20 words so this will get published...bottom line, I am really glad I gave this product a shot...it does exactly what I wanted it to."
520,1,"A great read: This is the story of a crime in the last century in a rural part of Louisiana. But it is also much more. It includes a fine series of chapters explaining the history of the Acadian people (Begnaud was an Acadian in a whistle stop) and of all the major players and of Louisiana history. In a short set of chapters the author gives us both the history and the interest. By the end I was sorry to see it finish - but I learned a lot about both the ""crime of the century"" and also the context of the events. It was hard to put down - even when I came to the end. Arceneaux did a thorough history but also took care to make it a fascinating book."
521,1,"More Spark than Malice: A well woven tapestry of the history and sociology of the Acadians of Louisiana, the South in post reconstruction years, and the genealogy of the authors family all neatly tied together in the telling of the tale of a murder which at the time was an international sensation even though it took place in the back waters of Louisiana. William Arceneaux is a smooth talker in person and has proved himself a skillful writer and clever story teller. There is one vignette on euthanasia that you may not want to read because it will haunt you when you wake up in a dark room at 3 o'clock in the morning. This an entertaining, even educational, well conceived and organized book."
522,1,"Mighty compact Vacum: Great product for the price. This has great suction and ease of use. The only thing I don't care for is if you vacum for a long time, the machine tends to get too warm. Other than that I love it."
523,1,"Good Buy!: I bought this 3 years ago, and it still works fine until now. Honestly it exceeded my expectation this vacuum cleaner cleans very well with good suction, for all 3 different homes, one with tiles, one with carpet, and now laminate floor. I use it almost everyday, I lived in Miami and now reside Hawaii, we take home sand quite often. For the price I have no complain, although I'd like it better if the handle were adjustable, but that's not really a con. If mine were ever broken, I'd buy this very same thing again."
524,1,Good replacement: Bought this timer to replace the previous one I had for 10 years which finally gave out. This timer is Identical to my old one. Works great.
525,1,"enjoyable 5th: I don't know if this is the definitive version of Bruckner's 5th, but I really enjoy this release. The sound quality and balance are excellent. The reading is controlled, but dynamic. This has to be the most difficult Bruckner symphony to critique because it is definitely a most unusual work, but I love it! When I want to listen to the 5th from Bruckner, I usually pop this one into my player. The Thielemann 5th (on DG) is also excellent, but it is sadly not SACD even though the sonics are still excellent. If DG decides to release the Thielemann on SACD I will definitely buy it, but I would still keep this one."
526,1,"Great Value: I almost didn't buy this DVD when I saw the first review, but I have bought quite a number of titles in this Popflix series and I have always been pleased with them.This Cary Grant package is a great value. You get three of Grant's classic comedies for the price of one DVD. The quality is good. It's not up to contemporary film stanards, but these are after all 50 year old movies. Given their age, the quality is fine and it is about what you would expect.On the whole, it is an exceptional value and well worth acquiring.BR"
527,1,"Great Picture, Great sound: Before I bought this TV, I went to the consumer reports web site. This TV is listed as a best buy (for 32"" TVs) so I bought it. The picture is great, as is the sound. This TV has the high end flat screen, but is not cluttered with interesting buy relatively unuseful features like Picture in Picture (PIP loses coolness after 1 week). So what you get is a great TV for a great price."
528,1,"Nice little plant: I bought this plant for a new freshwater 20 gallon aquarium I set up at work. My African Dwarf frogs love it, and at least one is often hiding underneath the lower leaves. It is shorter than 8 inches (maybe if you stretched it out it would be that long). Other than that it looks great and I'm happy with it."
529,1,"Hardcore: This is one of the most ground breaking debuts albums that came out of the West coast underground in the early 90s. This album is not C-BO's best work, but a must have for all C-BO fans."
530,1,good listening: i have owned more than one copy of this cd. both were stolen. i would purchase it again.
531,1,THE SICCEST 1 EVER: EVERY SONG CRACKS ON THIS 1 JUST LIKE LYNCH C-BO SHOWS THE BESTRAPPERZ COME STRAIGHT FROM SAC-TOWN
532,1,pondmaster pump: Good durable pump. Works well if you have a sufficiently large filter so that you dont have to clean the filter frequently.
533,1,"Good pump for the price!: So far so good. Works better than any I have had from local Home Depot, PetSmart, etc.I use it to return water to top pond from bottom, and it works well."
534,1,"It is Poe.: Like other Poe volumes, some things aren't worth reading. He gets rather wordy on some of the pieces.Can't beat the price."
535,1,Just what I wanted: It had all of his greatest books like tell tale heart. And the table of contents worked just fine. I RECOMMEND for teachers.
536,1,"Great heavy reading: Only if you are into heavy reading do you want to hit on this. It is great but as with any great author, requires a good vocabulary"
537,1,"Good: It's a good version of some great works by a wonderful author. There are a few mistakes here and there, but I won't complain too much since it was free."
538,1,"2nd book of an good compilation of works: Since I'm a huge Edgar Allen Poe fan, this book was perfect as part of two others. My only criticism is that I wish all three (?) books could have been combined into one."
539,1,"Oh, Mr. Poe...: The best thing about this is that it was free. I love Edgar Allan Poe and his poetry/short stories, but it being free and portable on my Kindle makes it all the better."
540,1,"Poe is timeless: Love every story by Edgar Allan Poe. His work is timeless, his imagination is brilliant and his language is lush and rich. True masterpiece!"
541,1,Read your classics. Poe is one of the greats.: Great download and free too. Poe is just one of those amazing writers that everyone should read and on the kindle is a great way to catch up.
542,1,The works of Edgar Allan Poe volume 2: I have always been intrigued and captivated by Master Poe's works...I find these capable of still captivating and intriguing me...read on!!!!!
543,1,"A great writer.: Full of rich analogies, metaphors, and deep congruences... a great story, almost-real characters, and a poetic yet unpretentious prose style. Good science fiction, and good literature."
544,1,"Their best yet: The first time I listened to ""Lullabies"" was on an 11-hour flight to London so I had plenty of time to relax and let the music sink in. After my first listen, I couldn\'t believe what I had heard. The album seemed so boring and slow. After so much excitement from hearing Little Sister, I was incredibly disappointed. Yet I wanted to give it another shot. So I did, and I ended up listening to the album at least 15 times during my one week stay in Oxford.It\'s now my favorite QOTSA album. I used to think Rated R was their best, because it had the most diversity but I just think Lullabies is a more cohesive album, and a creepy one at that. It definitely has a grotesque, nightmarish quality to it. I really can\'t get enough of it. I was too quick to write it off, but it gets better with each listen. Favorite song: The Blood Is Love.For the full experience, listen to it in the darkest room you can find with a good pair of headphones. Mind blowing."
545,1,"A very good follow up to a great previous effort: While it doesn't have the hooks of Songs for the Deaf or the riskiness of Rated R, the new brew from Homme and crew does what its supposed to - make my neck sore, my hands crampinto permanent devil horns and my neighbors call the cops. There are plenty of gems on this disk, contrary to a previous review, but some will sparkle more for the die-hard fans than the newly baptised. Lullabies to Paralyze will probably bring more followers into the fold and undoubtedly they will find even more inspiration in the previous gospels of the Queens but it will not convert them as quickly or as plentifuly as did Songs for the Deaf, which owes thanks in part to three great singles, two great videos, and a hell of a lot of coverage by the media surrounding Grohl's much hyped return to the stool. As for those of us that have been here for a while, the dark forces of the desert rock are strong in this one and shall feed the masses until the next serving."
546,1,"new lineup - and it dont matter: stoner rock is great, although it is almost non-existent today, fine with me, i got all my kyuss and qotsa albums to feed my need for the desert blues!!! i heard the whole album, and must say that it will go down as another classic QOTSA albums. and its even better than songs for the dead, since it doesnt have those radio interruptions, which i sucessfully edited out with an mp3 editor.-i suggest getting your hands on; QOTSA self titles album, rated R, songs for the dead and to see where QOTSA came from, get yourself best of Kyuss album, where josh holmes was the lead guitars, and u will see that he pretty much keeps the same style on almost everything he lays his hands on.-desert sessions is also quite interesting glimpse of crazy rocknroll, since they record a whole album in less than a month, 9and10 were recorded in like a week or so.-what happened to nick? he was a craziest drug induced bassist -right next to nicky sixx"
547,1,"Killer new album: Don't believe all the hype that the Queens suck now because Nick Oliveri was fired from the band and now this album will be awful. While it is different than it's predecessors, heading even further in the direction of Songs For the Deaf as far as conception and overall sound, this album ROCKS. Just listen to songs like Little Sister, Medication, Tangled Up in Plaid, and the long space-outs Someone's In the Wolf and The Blood Is Love. Heady (and heavy) stuff!"
548,1,"This is the good stuff, come on y\'all, and take a little bit: For all of the NIN fans who think that ""change is good"", listen to how it\'s really done. After beginning to listen to ""Lullibies to Paralyze"", the first three tracks had me worried . But it would get better. Much better. If I were to rate tracks 4-13 only, they would easily get 5 stars. Up until ""Songs for the Deaf"", I really did think that Josh Homme, whom I have been a fan of since his beginnings with Kyuss, could do no wrong. I thought that half of ""Songs for the Deaf"" was killer, but there was half filler too. But with his new album, Homme realy does show that he is on top of his game as a songwriter. If you don\'t like this, you\'re just not getting it. Your loss. And as I fade away..."
549,1,"Get a clue: This cd is great, but the Amazon.com reviewer, Aidin Vaziri, is obviously not informed about the band of which he writes. If he were he would have known this is the FOURTH QOTSA release not the third. The band's releases in order are Queens of the Stone Age, Rated R, Songs for the Deaf and finally,Lullabies."
550,1,"Less Than SFTD but still Great: The Cd Starts off soft with ""this lullaby""then goes straight into ""medication""this is what Queens of the Stone Age isthey have guitars that either stay in one place or go everywherethey never take it in the middle it is either fast or slowand like in the next song ""everybody knows that your insane"" they do just thatgo slow in the beginning then switch to fasttheres not building up they just go fasternothing subtle here folksthe singer\'s vocals (if you havent heardgtg do the rest later"
551,1,"Paralyzingly Brilliant: This one took a few listens to appreciate and now is near impossible to stop listening to. It is brilliantly produced and the song-craftmanship is fantastic. There are so many different audio colors and tracks going on within each song that you can\'t possibly get everything on just 1, 2 or even 3 listens. The DVD version is a must as you get to see highlights of the album being made track by track. The songs are all fantastic and a bit more ""mature"" than their previous efforts. Some are really quite ""haunting"" in atmosphere - really unexpected at times, and very, very cool. The previous QOTSA CD\'s are all great albums, but this one is by far the most cohesive and well executed. Nick O. really is not missed at all except for his spastic vocals - I was surprised at this as he\'s been such a partner to Josh for so long. All in all a fantastic cd that is a must for your collection."
552,1,"A step behind ""songs for the deaf"" but yet quite good: Now QOTSA, is pure Homme, just Homme and nothing but Homme but im certain that QOTSA have been Homme since the genesis of the band and that collaborations from Olivieri and Lanegan and Grohl have just provided interesting elements to the music recorded in previous albums but ""the Queens"" basic element is definitelly Homme and this time ""Lullabies to Paralyze"" is the chance he have to prove that and he have done just fine, maybe not in the amazing way we knew before but fine, very enjoyable cuts we can appreciate here, ""burn the witch"" ,""Everybody Knows That You Are Insane"" and of course ""Little Sister"", it just worths the money spent for this cd, maybe for the next record Homme should recruit the formula included in ""Songs for the deaf"" and the result as we already know will be even betterHM"
553,1,"Very Good: What a great album. Someone's in the Wolf is an incredible song, as are Insane, Little Sister, In My Head, Plaid, and Burn the Witch. The album like mentioned above is a tale of two sides.After songs 2-8 is loses some steam, but those songs in and of itself make for a great album. While it does not hold the firepower of their debut(but not many do) it is superior to both Rated R and Songs for the Deaf.QOTSA are the most gifted hard rock band of today."
554,1,"Very Cool!: Okay, some of the long time fans of QOFTSA are not sold on this becase Oliveri is gone. While Oliveri is a great bass player I can honestly say I do not miss his ""death metal"" vocals. Granted this CD is different from ""Songs..."" but still great. It took me a couple of times through before this CD really struck a note with me. Now I really love it. Lullabies"" is not as heavy overall as ""Songs.."" but I feel as a whole these songs in a lot of ways are stronger. Check out ""Burn The Witch"". Listen to this tune a couple of times and you want be able to get it out of your head. Totally cool groove on this song. As I said it is different from ""Songs..."" but still very good. Check it out."
555,1,"i love this album!: This album has got a creepy quirky feel that I like about it. I actually get into this more than ""Songs for the deaf"", because I find it a bit less easy listening and more experimental, which is the stuff I like. While there may not be an anthemic ""no one knows"", tracks like ""medication"" ""little sister"" ""in my head"" the 2 haunting ""tangled up in plaid"" and ""someone\'s in the wolf"" and the gorgeous ""i never came"" certainly make up for it. I haven\'t listened to Rated R yet but am tempted to. Josh Holmes and the band rock. The departure of the other guy is not a problem for me. Quite on the contrary I enjoy more Josh\'s singing than Nick\'s screaming, and I don\'t think Queens have lost in bass...Dark, twisted, everybody knows that you\'re insane!!!!!!!"
556,1,"Troy is very underrated: It is an amazing album,i love it, the inclusion of troy takes the music to another level, buy it! Everybody knows that youre insane is out of this world!"
557,1,"Stone solid.: I was a Kyuss fan from back when and had the previous QOTSA album Songs For The Deaf, so I got this. I always thought of this album as the lesser of the two, but the more I hear it I think it\'s just as good. It\'s not really ""metal"" heavy, but there\'s a heaviness to it, some slow churning rock. I suppose that\'s why they\'re tossed into the stoner rock genre alot. They kind of epitomize it. The lone hit here ""Little Sister"" is actually one of my least fave songs. I wont go through the other tracks here, they are all mostly good. The title fits this record well."
558,1,"Overall a very good cd: Although it doesn\'t come out of the corner swinging like ""R"" and ""Songs For The Deaf"" it\'s a long round fighter so to speak, the longer you listen to it the more it knocks you out. Queens of the Stone age are one of those bands that has staying power, even after losing one of the founding members, Joshua Homme shows that he still has the touch. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes this style of music."
559,1,"QOTSA minus Nick........: is still good, but I think what made QOTSA so awesome in the first place was the diversity of the vocalists. Lets face it, Josh is a great singer, but he can't sing low and gritty like Mark and definately can't scream like Nick. The different vocals are what kept anything from sounding the same.Even though it is my least favorite QOTSA album, it is still great and has some amazing songs, the best being Tangled up in Plaid."
560,1,"It takes awhile to sink in, but once it does you\'re hooked!: When I first heard this album, I was like WTF?! Now I can\'t stop listening to it. One thing I find odd is how the song ""The Blood Is Love"" is getting somewhat poor reviews. In my opinion it is the best track on the album - I simply can\'t get it out of my head. I don\'t think it\'s possible to top ""Songs for the Deaf"", but this is a perfect step in another direction."
561,1,"Finally some new QoTSA: It took me 5 or 6 times to really get in the flow of this album, but after I let go of the fact that's it's quite different from their previous efforts, I'm finding a breadth of familar Queens and some great new sounds. The excellent lyrics and vocals of Tangled Up In Plaid and Broken Box, and the catchy guitar riffs of In My Head and Little Sister are just some of what I've dug so far. Good stuff."
562,1,"Be Patient With The Record, It Will Payoff: For you Queens fans, I\'m glad that they didn\'t make a ""Songs For The Deaf"" Part II. While ""SFTD"" was more of hard rock record, ""Lullabies"" incorporates a lot more different influences. ""Burn The Witch (Swamp Boogie), ""Someone\'s In The Wolf (Led Zeppelin), ""Broken Box"" (Love & Rockets !!) and the string of three hard rockers (Medication, Insane, & Tangled Up In Plaid). As usual, Josh\'s pyschedelic and Cream influences are splattered throughout the record.Complaints: ""In My Head"" and ""I Never Came"" are filler. ""Medication"" almost sounds like a ""Feel Good Song Of The Summer"" rewrite. Joey Castillo is still their worst drummer and his drums really have been mixed down in this record.It\'s great record to listen to at 1 in the morning. Be patient with the record as a whole and make sure you sit down and give the proper time to give it a good listen alone. Without a doubt, buy this record !!"
563,1,"Raises important issues and offers viable solutions: I read Robert Frank's book, Luxury Fever, right after finishing Barbara Kingsolver's new book, The Poisonwood Bible. I recommend both and I recommend reading them in this order. Kingsolver points out the callous and self-serving nature of middle and upper-class America in a very emotional way. Frank points out the same in a much more dispassionate way and then offers viable solutions. I found this book to be well-written, even-handed, thorough, and absorbing. I highly recommend it."
564,1,"Blessing: I'm a certified Nurse Midwife. Carolyn, my wife, is a labor and delivery nurse. We live with our daughter, Hilary, in Chinle, Arizona. Right in the middle of the great Navajo Nation. Dr. Organick's book truly captures the spirit and beauty of our area and the Navajo people. I found that from the moment i picked up this delightful book, i was unable to put it down. We have read quite a few books about our area of the world and especially about the Navajo people, but have found nothing that is as enjoyable or easy to read. We have sent copies to friends and relativies and will continue to do so. This is the best book we've found to give everyone a feel for a great area and a great people."
565,1,"Favorite train!: Our battery operated train is almost 20 years old! It still operates and looks brand new. We adopted two babies, and I have to buy one more so they stop fighting over it! Worth every penny. Batteries last a very very long time."
566,1,For a British Child: We purchased this book for our grandson who is British. It proved a superb explanation of the colonies with captivating illustrations to acquaint him with his heritage.
567,1,Nice for a boy or girl: I like this crib set alot. I bought it for my first baby. It is for a boy. The colors on this set are real nice but is more of a yellow and yellow-green then green. I was hoping for more green but I am still not disapointed.
568,1,"Fun for the not so rough kid: My daughter got this 9 months ago. She loves it, as does most of the neighbors. Because it is not made for overly rugged use, I have limited the size of kids on this bike. So far, the only thing that has fallen prey to the kids misuse was one of the plastic pipes on the side, which can be easily fixed. I would not recommend this for the child that likes to do stunts, as the wheel frames are made of plastic."
569,1,I've purchased Frommers for most of my adult life: This version was the usual reliable source of information. Yet I could not find one piece of important information in this book. We went through US Customs before our flight out of Calgary. My first experience with US Customs in another country. Please allow a little extra time before your flight for US Customs.
570,1,Water filter: Purchased the water filter and installed it per the instructions. I had a pre drilled hole in the granet. Works great. Easy to change the filters. I also signed up for the automated filter delivery. Every 6 months you receive a new one. Great reminder when it's time to change the filter.
571,1,"Great Gift.: I got this book for my wife who studies music and she liked it, it has a great variety. You might want some clips to keep it open on your music stand however, It would have been nice if it was a spiral bound book. Other than that no complaints, great gift."
572,1,"One of the best!: One of the best books ever written on the subject of divine healing, by one of the best authors ever! As with all books by A. Murray, the spotlight is on ""sanctification"" of the people of God in this book. Why do you want to be healed? What are you going to do with your healing? Be ready to have the Lord probe into your heart. Recently retitled ""Healing Secrets.""Randy"
573,1,"Excellent work on Divine healing: John G Lake mentions this book in his writings, so I was very interested in reading it for myself. I was not disappointed. Andrew Murray presents a scriptural basis for Divine healing. He believed that salvation is for the body as well the soul, healing and forgiveness go hand in hand. He presents Christ as healer, and our need to take Him at His word. It can be hard to take, but he does believe that more sickness than we may think, is used as discipline. However with repentance, healing comes. This is a great work on healing, and I recommend it to all who desire to see God glorified in the healing of the body."
574,1,Divine Healing by Andrew Murray: Great Book by a Great minister. teaching other about healing and how to obtain it. very much based on the Scriptures.
575,1,"NOIR FOR CONNOISSEURS!: It doesn\'t get any better than this. The delicious writing and cool, gritty ""look"" of the film is perfect. No one\'s more male, sexy or gorgeous than Richard Conte at his height, an icon of 1950\'s style and attitude, in love with a young, blonde femme fatale. But once she (Cornel Wilde\'s real wife Jean Wallace) finds out that he\'s married, God help him."
576,1,"Great movie for fans of film noir and cinematographer John Alton.: This is one of the gems of the film noir genre that is often overlooked. The best part of the movie is the incredible cinematography by John Alton. Also the cast, including a supporting role by Van Cleef, the ""good the bad and the ugly"" star who plays the bad in the legendary western. Great addition to anyones film noir collection."
577,1,Best of Film Noire: This is one of the very best of the genre. Right up there with the Maltese Falcon.
578,1,Turtle too much fun: With the exception of the hard plastic squeaker in the belly of the turtle (which we had successfully broken within 10 minutes) this toy is great. The strange shape causes a unique bounce. It's size makes it easy to carry. It is now our favorite toy.
579,1,"KENYA LOVES THIS TOY: our Great Dane, Kenya, actually stole this toy from her Rat Terrier cousin, Ray Charles. She has a green one and can't do without it now. She completely ignores all other toys, and knows where the green turtle is at all times. I ordered a bear for her and can't wait to see if she likes it. She loves to throw it and let it bouce around uncontrolably. I provides a lot of play time when I'm not around."
580,1,"Does what I want it to do: I purchased this flashlight primarily for the blue LEDs - I need to be able to see highlighted text in the dark, and the blue LEDs cause most yellow, green or orange hi-lighter ink to flouresce. The three blue LEDs provide a fairly uniform pool of light rather than a tightly focused beam. (Some other LED flashlights use a lense or other tricks to focus the output). The three white LEDs are medium-bright, and should light up a tent or the corner of the garage adequately. So far, so good - buttons work well, construction is pretty solid, and I'm still on the first set of batteries. It takes two AA's, which is really ideal for this type of small flashlight - I expect to get dozens of hours per set.One complaint: no lanyard, nor is there a way to attach one. I ended up drilling small holes in the cap, to connect a split-ring as a lanyard attachement."
581,1,"being grateful: this is a great book. after 4 months of consistently writing in it every night, i noticed a shift in my way of thinking about the world...i was able to see more abundance than scarcity."
582,1,"Have Used This Journal for More Than A Decade: I love the design and working format of this journal! It keeps me on track by providing a great framework but limits amount of writing to one line for each thought you want to list. This is great for me b/c I normally would write more ""to fill the blank page"" and then become daunted by the daily nature of the gratitude practice. The only reason I put 4 stars is because for the first time in over a decade of using these journals, this year\'s came without the marker ribbon. It doesn\'t look like it ever had one. I hope this was a fluke and not a new, cost cutting measure taken by the publisher! Otherwise, l love this book....it helps keep me sane!"
583,1,"One of the best Gratitude Journals I have found.: Even when faced with serious struggles, I like to say to myself, ""The good thing about this is..."" Simple Abundance offers gentle reminders that there is always something to be thankful for. Keep it by your bed for sweeter dreams."
584,1,"Happy Customer: I was happy with the prompt service,andthe condition of the book. I will order again from this service."
585,1,"My Abundant Living: I kept this journal while reading Simple Abundance. After a few weeks I became aware that what I was most grateful for in my life was not 'things', but the activities in which I engaged. Living, not having, is where the fun is in our lives. I still journal occasionally, but only to remember the details of special events I want to savor."
586,1,Gratitude Journal for 2013: I have used this Gratitude Journal in the past and find it helps me be more aware of the blessings in my life every day.
587,1,"A Wonderful Tool For Enrichment: This lovely book is perfect for recording those small (and large) blessings that truly constitute abundance. Some other reviewers have found fault with what they found to be limited space. But I think they've missed the point. This book never claimed to be a journal in the usual sense. When I write down a phrase or sentence describing something for which I am grateful, it opens the door to a realization of more and yet more things for which I am grateful. When I'm feeling low, I sometimes go back and read earlier entries and find myself smiling and experiencing again the joy of gratitude. Just this morning, I was reading some old entires and this phrase came into my mind: Happiness is a renewable resource. That thought in itself is a blessing to me. I've purchased two of these books in the past and am about to purchase several more, some for myself and some for gifts. It works!"
588,1,"SUPER FUNNY: Ya gotta love it, funny flick. Bill and Ted beat death and win the girls. Hell will never be the same since they were there."
589,1,"Great Movie: If you need a quick and easy way to get some laughs, then this movie is for you. Bill and Ted play lots of games with Death and meet Station a weird but somewhat gross character that helps them with their adventures. Makes one think about life again..."
590,1,"Same but different as the first one: More of the same humor, as Bill and Ted are now DEAD and have to fight it out with the Grim Reaper to get back their lives so they can go home and be with their girls. Still funny, still nothing spectacular. A very good match with their ""most excellent adventure"", but again, not a real classic. It won\'t let you down as long as you aren\'t expecting a movie that redefines comedy. Want a good laugh? This will not let you down."
591,1,"Good Goofy Comedy: Bill & Ted II, BOGUS JOURNEY has the wacky duo meeting themselves in a dangerous heavy-metal form. Good and Evil. Hell and Music. Special Effects make the rating for 4-stars. IMHO, it is not as good as the first."
592,1,"WHO: mike jones is too hot and thats all there is to it. cop this cd along wit all the past ones. best underground legend. and can someone help me out, what is that song called that has the yodler in the backround????"
593,1,"Damn they go off: Say say these H-town day 2 day grindas all ready got they first album drop 1st round draft picks i suggest you buy this cd if you have never heard swishahouse before. soon other cds droppin from these 2 guys ""who is Mike Jones"" & ""rookie of the year"" from magno.

594,1,to b skilz on mike jones: hey b skilz mike jones is hot and the name of the cut you are referring to is called Cuttin' peace
595,1,"this is day to day grindin!!!: what more can i say Mike Jones put it down on this one, but this album wouldnt be the same without Magno on it. once again it comes with regular and screwed up cds. so we all know its definetly worth it. Lil Flip, Who?"
596,1,mob style for life: this is one of the greatest albums made today in the rap game.one of the only rap crews that i can truly say that what you hear is what they truly live.this is truly for the real street cats that know and respect the history of the mob style crew. new york stand up for real.
597,1,Management Information Systems: The book is exactly the same as what I would have purchased through the college book store and it's $30 or $40 cheaper. It also arrived within three to five business days. Glad I purchased through Amazon.
598,1,worth the money: This is something you will really need to keep you camcorder save and sound. Defenitely worth the money.
599,1,Perfect companion for your 405 !: This accesory kit is the perfect companion for your DCR-405. It's fits perfectly on the main compartment and it's very portable.It's a must for a Handycam propietary !!!
600,1,"Great purchase for the price.: If you don't want to carry around too large of a bag for your camcorder, this is the bag for you. It is a perfect fit for your camcorder and its DVD case which is included in the kit. It is also nice how the case closes making it hard for anyone nearby to reach into the case. I highly recommend this product."
601,1,A very good deal: I did not believe when i first saw this deal at such a low price. This is really a wonderful deal.
602,1,"Beginners luck: This book ia a compilation of four sumi-e instructional series; Sumi-e in Three weeks, Floral Sumi-e in three weeks, Animal Sumi-e in three weeks, and Landscape Sumi-e in three weeks. The artist welcmes you to the world of Zen art by detailing the history and the influences of the traditions of the far east. Each section has details in ""how to"" for the beginner as the author walks you through each phase of learning the fine art of sumi-e. All of the instructional illustrations are progressive with details on each step and the final completed picture on the same page. Included in this book are some of the worlds most beautiful examples of the art of sumi-e. I have enjoyed the presentation of the author and give this book a high recomendation."
603,1,"Must-Have Book: Since my wife Gloria is as interested in this period of our history as I am, (well, almost), I thought she might enjoy having this book. Boy, did I hit the center of the bullseye! She, and I, love it. If you are old enough to remember this period of our history like we are I think you will get a lot of enjoyment and many pleasant memories form owning this collection. For those of you too young to have these experiences (I still remember the tensions my family experienced during the Cuban Missile Crisis), I think you will enjoy having this book as well.It is a valuable part of our history and should be remembered by each Amnerican.Adding this tremendous collection of photographs and text will make as outstanding a contribution to your family library as is has to ours."
604,1,"Almost all what you need: This is an excelent material. Get this book, and buy another pack of practice tests from the web (plenty of them around) and you're all set. Just keep in mind that you need to have solid bases to benefit from this book and other practice tests; Nobody and nothing will teach you probability, algebra, grammar, etc... in a month. The author has a good sense of humor, which makes this book more readable and not so boring in such the painful task of studying for GMAT. Only drawback is that quantitative section problems in the real one are more difficult (better say, more time consuming) than the ones that come in ANY practice test. Always keep in mind that this is an ADAPTIVE test when studying, so, create your strategy for how much time to spend on the first 10-15 questions of each section."
605,1,Princeton Review study guide mirrors actual test: I found that the Princeton Review guide along with the ETS PowerPrep and the Official Guide to the GMAT to be very representative of the actual test. I took one of the Princeton Review CAD test the morning of my actual GMAT test and made the exact same score on both. I also used Kaplan but found my test results much lower than what I actually scored.
606,1,"THANK YOU: I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR INTRICATELY PUTTING TOGETHER ONE OF THE FINEST STUDY GUIDES AVAILABLE. LARGELY DUE TO YOUR STUDY GUIDE I SCORED A 630 ON THE GMAT, AND I CANNOT THANK YOU MORE!!!"
607,1,love it: These bags are easy to switch out and they come with a cap so you don't get a billow of dust in your face.
608,1,"perfect fit!: I really like the fact that amazon can ship this to my front door cheaper than me driving to the vacuum store and sitting in traffic, what a deal!"
609,1,"Literally gave me nightmares...: While I don't think this is a brand new problem, the author tackles a difficult subject from a modern perspective, with much focus on the role of children and the recruitment of children into militia and small armed forces rather than state-sponsored armies.Many parts of the book were truly shocking, particularly the descriptions of the indoctrination methods used by the organizers of child soldiers to make the children into soldiers capable of greater atrocities than adults.The author's clear writing, thoughtful explanation, and collection of a wide range of source material all make this an excellent introduction to this important topic. It's also nice that the author includes endnotes to point to sources and allow for futher research."
610,1,"Bierce's command of the language is stunning.: To anyone interested in the English language and its application by a master story teller, this author must be read. Bierce is an American wit equal to (and contemporary of) Mark Twain, and he writes not with a pen dipped in ink but with a scalple dipped in bile. Prepare to be scathed."
611,1,Enchanting Music: The Music gives you the best depiction of what it sounds like to hear the music in a desert. Very good.
612,1,"1994? STILL accurate..: The expected return of Christ as judge is exciting and His return for unbelievers will be horrible. Read why in this book. Fact is, God through His word has given us more info since the year 1994. (This is my opinion, Mr. Camping has not said this but because of his teachings this idea does not seem too foreign) It could be that the 7th seal was opened in 1994 and for 5 years there will be a period of ""silence"" or perhaps the calm before the storm. The number 5 is significant in the bible (1/2 hour or .5 may equal the grace of God). It seems possible that God, in His mercy extended His grace for unbelievers for 5 years since 1994 which would bring us to Sept-Oct. 1999! Camping, a true believer has shared his insights on the comming judgement and if I were not born again I would be scared stiff. Please get the book."
613,1,"online friends beware!: This book is about a boy named Sam who plays chess on the internet as part of a school project. He has a friend named Vlad who lives in Romanina. Sam's brother and cousin think that Vlad is a vampire. Vlad likes to stay up late and dislikes garlic. Could he really be a vampire? Find out with Sam when Vlad comes to the United States to play in a chess tournament!With simple vocabulary, even the lowest reader can read and enjoy this book.I recommend this book to any student who enjoys or wants to start reading mystery books."
614,1,"work well but give you a slightly odd profile: They have a bigger opening than the soft shells, so they're much more comfortable. They work well to keep air on sore nipples. They make your boob shape a little strange, but not terrible, and it's definitely worth it."
615,1,"Not Inconspicuous: They are great to wear at home either at night or on weekends. They do not form with the breast and make your breast look weird when worn.ALTERNATIVE USE:I use them when pumping. When I pump one breast at a time, I put the shell to the breast that is not being pumped. Since it leaks, I collect the milk and don't waste it at all!"
616,1,great album: This is a great album and includes the best of EW&F plus some collaborations with other artists and singers from the era.
617,1,"Amazing sound and comprehensive collection: Amazing sound quality and a more comprehensive selection than the recent ""Greatest Hits"" CD for just a few dollars more makes this the definitive one-package EW&F collection and the place to start for those curious about the late-1970s number one R&B/funk outfit."
618,1,"Classic Soul: Soul, r&b, jazz, funk, it's all in the music of Earth Wind and Fire. This is one of the premiere soul funk bands that has managed to last for more than thirty years and with good reason. With few exceptions, their music has always been balanced and focused, their beginning sounds having a very African oriented tinge. Essential Earth has all their sounds on it, and remastered version are always excellent."
619,1,"Very Essential: you can never have enough of the Elements to me.this is a Solid Collection of there Material in a double Disc Set.you have Earth,Wind&Fire in all there glory.there Original Line-up was no Joke they Ripped a stage up&back.strong Instrumentation,Arragements&the Vocals are on point.Maurice White Leads the Charge here with the Band&Brings so Much Life&a Feeling of Joy&Warmth on these Tracks.there Music is still a Strong Source for me."
620,1,"Great book.: It had me staring at the stars out of my window at night, listening to the crickets, and wondering, ""what in the world am I doing with my life?"""
621,1,"Too cute!: It's a really cute bobo (pacifier) makes my lil' cutie fat man have a lil' extra personality, love it! Would suggest this and any other one to anybody!"
622,1,"cute pacifier: I love this paciifer! It makes me laugh every time I see it! It also made my son and daughter in law laugh!Sturdy packaging, fast shipping!"
623,1,Looks very funny: Very funny. By the time my twins were big enough to use it they stopped using pacifiers. I dont remember the age requirements for this.
624,1,"Funny pacifier!: This was a gift to my boss for her 6 month old son. She commented on the packaging and quality of the pacifier. It's not cheap or thin plastic. The way the part that goes into the mouth is shaped she says was just like the expensive ones, a comfortable fit for him. She totally approved- and that's hard because she's a fist time mom and rightfully picky about what her baby has. Needless to say....that photo of him using it was hilarious! Her and the hubby get a kick out of it."
625,1,Gift: I purchased this item for a friend that had a baby and she loves it!I am happy to have made her baby look silly!
626,1,"Holy Jesus this album is good: I have about 6 MTX albums and this ranks up there with 'Revenge is Sweet and So are You.' I thought I had all the good ones until I picked this one up a few months ago. Some highlights of the album are 'Book of Revelation,' 'Master of the Situation,' 'See it Now' and 'Ready Set Go.'These guys rank with the best live. So go see them if you get a chance."
627,1,"The inaugural event of the French Nouvelle Vague: Godard anointed it ""Faulkner meets Stravinsky"". That should be enough of an evaluation. But if you insist...Hiroshima Mon Amour is equally beautiful and baffling. The challenge of the film is its narrative structure, which fluidly blends past and present through bursts of flashback. You might say that the form of the film is a cinematic attempt at capturing the mechanism of memory at work (who can really know if it was a successful attempt, memory is a subjective experience).Marguerite Duras\' screenplay is chillingly spare, but a subtle beauty, Sacha Vierny\'s cinematography, with all its graceful tracking shots is the work of a master, and Emanuelle Riva and Eiji Okada, the handsomely paired couple at the center are played with tenderness and sympathy, and eventually a bitter edge. Alain Resnais pulls them all together for a film that is something of a revolution."
628,1,"A Haunting Dream of Love: Not everyone will appreciate this highly subjective study of two emotionally wounded lovers in the aftermath of war, but please give it a chance. No other film captures the emotions and inner life of its characters like this. Resnais has such an amazing asthetic sense. Even the simplest images and words become deeply compelling and unforgetable under his direction. The script, by the celebrated erotic novelist Marguerite Duras, is also first rate."
629,1,"Fantastic Movie: One of the best movies I've seen recently. I was stunned after I watched it. The writing was amazing, the acting was breathtaking, the cinematography was stunning. In short, a fantastic film."
630,1,"Be kind to your follow reviewers: When I first saw Hiroshima Mon Amour back in late 70s, I hated every minute of it. To me, at that time, it was the worst movie I had ever seen. The story was out of focus, the characters looked pale and without any emotions. But it was then.Now, after more than 25 years, after a heartbreaking episode of my life, I begin to appreciate the subtle theme that Duras and Renais wanted to convey : It is not easy to forget a person's past. What I want to say is, for those who find this movie hard to swallow might try to watch it, say, ten or fifteen years from now, maybe he or she would have a new perspective about the movie or his life, for that matter."
631,1,"Movie review: Wanted to see the performance for best actress oscar again in preparation for this year's selection. Excellent movie, a reminder of what what nuclear warfare can destroy. Excellent love story with both key actor performances at oscar level."
632,1,"You will not be able to get these songs out of your head!: It's a hit. This is definitely Unwritten Laws best album yet. Every song tells a story that you can relate to on some level and that's what makes it cool to listen to. Yes it's catchy and accessible, and at the same time it's the heaviest album they've created so far (the drums and bass are very metal), and that's exactly why it's so rad. Pick up this record you will be stoked."
633,1,"Adorable!: ""\'Twas the Night Before Christmas"" is such a classic. Although I\'ve heard some of the famous lines from this charming story, I never read it through. The illustrations are darling. This sweet little poem will get you in the holiday spirit. I recommend."
634,1,Good product: The cover is especially useful when running/working outside. The only (minor) problem is that the cutout for the headphone cable is in the middle of the top -- the iPod's is off to the side. I just nipped a little hole in the appropriate spot and it did the trick.
635,1,tunebelt ipod armband: The company described the item perfectly. The price was great and the delievry was very fast. I recommend using this company. Randy
636,1,"A great, great film: Haunting, mysterious, deep. I've seen this movie at least 10 times and I'm still picking up new layers of meaning. If you like to have your senses ravished and your intellect stimulated, you should see this film."
637,1,"Enchantment: After hearing only 1 cut from this album, I bought it right on the spot. If you think you have heard every rendition of Disley classics you ever want to, think again. There is not one single cut on this album that is not completely mesmerizing. Turn down the lights, light a candle, and completely relax with someone special, and by the end, if you can scrape yourself up, you'll replay the entire thing."
638,1,"A whole new set of ideas from reading this book.: I thought that the Media player was used for videos, music and online content. While this is true there is so much more that can be done with the application and this book will help guide you through.You'll find ways to create and manage video streaming sites, as well as creating and playing movie trailers. Yopu be given the ability to setup and take care of the Intranet media server and services.The authors have done just about everything for you except create the final presentation. They also included a cd with the book with a couple of useful and handy utilities like Producer and the SDK.Overall this book takes you from the beginning of the process to the Web Portal and beyond. The only limits you have is your imagination."
639,1,"Ótimo livro - Great Book: Aos brasileiros que buscam conhecimento sobre streaming. Esse livro é uma ótima fonte de conhecimento, visto que no é fácil encontrar isso no Brasil. Podem comprar que é muito bom. Ele aborda desde técnicas básicas de encoding até alguns cases mais complexos."
640,1,Panasonic Digital Camera Battery: This Panasonic battery does not hold its charge as long as the Lenmar battery. Very handy having more than one battery for use in my camera. This one is used up in about 150 pictures where the Lenmar goes to 200+.
641,1,A must have: The Lumax cameras this battery supports chews through it's batteries in no time. You always want a fully charged spare or two around while you are waiting for the original to recharge.
642,1,"Very Good Performance: I got this as a spare battery for my Panasonic Lumix TZ3 digicam. But it works really well to be called as a ""Spare"". The performance is fantastic, and it lasts me for over 150 shots. Does not perform as good as the original battery supplied by Panasonic, but for the price difference I would recommend it any day. Can be definitely had as a backup battery."
643,1,"Elixir of Wit: To read any of Karen Elizabeth Gordon\'s books is to be happily drunk on words. By turns informative, giddy, erotic, hilarious, mysterious and wondrous, it is almost incidental that this and her other books are also penultimate authoritative sources on English language grammar, usage and meaning. Read ""Out of the Loud Hound of Darkness"" and any of her other books that you can get your hands on!"
644,1,Out of the Loud Hound of Darkness: What is the difference between anodyne and androgyne? Follow this gambit through a gamut of word pairs to attain/obtain a clinquant mastery of English vocabulary and word usage.
645,1,"my mom loved it: i bought this dvd for my mom... she's a huge paquita fan... she still watches it whenever she can... if ur a fan, u'll luv it too."
646,1,"weirdly entertaining: A great big thank you to Professor White, in whose 20th Century Russian Prose class I read this book! The book has many levels - and even if you look no further than the very surface, it is a bizarre yet hilarious story. If you put more thought into the reading, it delves in to themes of good and evil and all that good stuff (and thankfully, Bulghakov is much more eloquent than I am). It was several years ago that I read this so I don't remember many of the details, but I do remember that it was my favorite piece that we read in the course. I lent my copy to a friend and I never got it back, which is too bad because I'm dying to read it again. One of these days when I can justify spending the money on a book I've already read, I'll get myself another copy. Until then, I'll just leave you with my highest recommendation! By the way, you do not at all need an extensive background in all things Russian in order to read this book. I am a scientist, not a historian, and I loved it!"
647,1,"don\'t let them tell you you need to know russian.: all that stuff about how this book is ""inaccessible"" to americans is totally ridiculous. this is an incredibly accessible book -- almost on a par with catcher in the rye or something like that for accessibility. it\'s a hilarious, incredible fable that ANYONE can enjoy.ask anyone who\'s read it (who isn\'t trying to show off that they know russian.) this book will stay with you forever. totally fun and breathtaking."
648,1,"This book is an intellectual's delight.: The Master and Margharita is a treasure chest of wild, creative thought and enthralling characters. I recommend it to anyone, particularly those tired of reading painfully dry Jane Austen or Emily Bronte novels."
649,1,"Nice: The product was unbelievably cheap and had free shipping, but arrived in almost no time at all. It was neatly packaged, decent quality, and is now hanging on my wall above my Darth Vader beer stein."
650,1,"A fun new series.: IRREGARDLESS OF MURDER was surprisingly fun for a mystery, and easy to read quickly. The book has wonderful characters, romance, and a few laughs. And it was fun to visit the Adirondacks again. This book promises a sequel, which will mean a good series has been born. I\'m looking forward to reading the next one. I found this book through a ""favorite cozies"" list on Amazon.com, and am I glad I did!"
651,1,"Noir to its very bones: The Bottom Line:A ""skid row"" production, Detour is an incredibly minimalist picture that manages to do a lot with very little and emerges as a interestingly-hard edged psychological thriller of a noir; the Hays Code-enforced ending detracts a little from the spirit of the film, but Detour is a diversion worth taking.3.5/4"
652,1,"Film Noir Classic and an Edgar G. Ulmer Masterpiece: Detour is one of the all-time great examples of film noir. The use of shadowy black and white cinematography, a star-crossed protagonist, a femme fatale, a cynical voice-over narration and ambiguous morality can almost be used to define the Film Noir Genre. Brought together by legendary director Edgar G. Ulmer in only a few days and on a diminutive budget, Detour's B-Film sets only add to both the film and the genre, a true testament to the mastery of Ulmer.Al Roberts (Tom Neal) makes a series of bad choices that bring him to a very low point in his life. Vera (Ann Savage) plays the quintessential Bad Girl. Their witty repartee and in truth, much of the dialogue throughout is a main attraction of this film. The plot is revealed in flashbacks and continues on uncompromisingly to the conclusion. The characterizations, dialogue, plot and photography all contribute to make this taut, gritty film a must for film noir enthusiasts."
653,1,"Classic Film Noir: Film Noir flourished in the forties and early fifties. Bogart's Maltese Falcon supposedly is the first film with a destructive hard guy and scarlet woman pairing. Love rarely works out and you're more likely to get bumped off than score the perfect heist. The cinematography is black and white with plenty of fog or dark shadows. There's an underlying dread, a cynical Chesterfield cigarette on the lip of coming doom.Detour is classic Film Noir. It's a B flick that is at first glance primitive, maybe shot in ten days. Tom Neal is in Ann Savage's web after he accidentally kills a man. It is so simple yet so intriguing. Ann Savage is forgotten, but not by me. She is the greatest evil woman ever in film. Rent this one immediately."
654,1,"NOIR AT IT'S DARKEST: Come on, it doesn't get cooler than 'Detour'! No budget, no stars, and a wacked-out story of hellish bad luck. Tom Neal is what passes for our hero, a pianist en route to the coast to meet up with his girl when 'fate sticks out a foot to trip him'. It's really amazing to see how great this thing turned out considering how little it had going for it. Watch it at like 3 a.m., when everything is a little foggy, and you'll appreciate it even more. Then, watch 'D.O.A.', and 'He Walked By Night'."
655,1,Nice sturdy ring.: Bought this ring to make fried pies and a stuffed cookie for my husband. The ring is very sturdy and will not bent or get mis-shapened when using. I would purchase again.
656,1,"Way of the Samurai...: This book is chalk full of philosophy and rules to live by. The author speaks from ancient Japan, but a multitude of his messages translate to today. Buy this book before any other."
657,1,"Unlike any other resource: The preface and introduction to the book by translator William Scott Wilson is essential to understanding the aphoristic musings of the author in context. As far as I can see (I do not know Japanese), the translation is literate even poetic. I have not found any other book which is a primary source on Bushido and I am using it as a supplement to teaching Mishima Yukio in a class on film and literature. I felt that students needed another context for Mishima's Samurai ideologies. We'll see how it goes down, as I haven't gotten to it yet."
658,1,"real wisdom lives forever: Excellent book. Very concize but so wise. You need to ""ignore"" the presentation a bit, adjust your mindset to the Japanese medieval realities. Then you will so how much is behind few words. It\'s on the dark side a bit, which is natural, just reflects the times it was created. But there are many interesting, deep and very true ideas about life, death, inspiration, duty, relationship and other important things. Enjoy!"
659,1,An excellent almost poetic view of samurai thought.: A previous review spoke of the passages in this book being a bit odd. I belive this book is a great way of begining shaping the mind to be open to the Way of the samurai. It is also interesting to note that although the author was never in any actual battles. The greatest sword ever made was never intended on being used.
660,1,"A way of life long ago, but still usefull for today: The book of hidden leaves ""Hagakure"" expresses the view of a man who lived in a time three hundred years past, but his words are still valid and usefull in today\'s society. They preach the values of men who will succeed in life, and if you take time to think about it they are still applicable for a person in present-day. ""A samurai will use a toothpick even though he has not eaten. Inside the skin of a dog, outside the hide of a tiger."""
661,1,"Hagakure: `Hagakure' aka `The Book of the Samurai' is an old Japanese text with many anecdotes and passages formed into short paragraphs that impart the wisdom of the Samurai's way of life. Whilst this book is very much `of its time' and may seem unusual at times to western readers, it has a lot to offer if you take the time to digest it's wisdom properly and think about the ideas enclosed. Far from being about fighting and killing (although these aspects are touched upon) this is about living with a certain peace and honour. Films, like `Ghost Dog', have made this more popular than it might have been, but there is a lot more to this book that you may originally perceive and you won't regret giving it a read and contemplating the wisdom inside. Worth adding to your martial arts and philosophy bookshelf.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
662,1,"Excellent: I read through this book once, then I read through it notating specific anecdotes that stood out to me and ended up marking about half the book. There is a ton of wisdom and insight into not just the Samurai way of life, but the way people - particularly men - have changed (mostly for the worse) over time. This book is not about how to fight, or even being a samurai so much as it is about spirit, and courage in the face of life as well as death. There is an occasional absurd anecdote, but 99% of this book is insightful to this day. Above all, this book is about being a man of principle, courage, and usefulness."
663,1,"Hagakure: An excellent foray into the mind of the Samurai. Details of the Samurai experience and the Samurai Code. Many hidden treasures in this book, you just have to look for them."
664,1,The finest book in publication on the Samurai way.: Hagakure is THE difinitive work on Samurai life in feudal Japan. Anyone with interest in Japanese Martial culture or martial arts MUST HAVE this book. I cannot reccomend this book enough!
665,1,"Well-written and Thought-Provoking: Yamamoto Tsunetomo\'s treatise is an intimate introduction to mentality of the samurai. You will not really learn too much so far as basic samurai history, but that is not really what this text sets out to discuss. ""Hagakure"" is very well-written book, which excels at conveying to the reader the depth of profundity and devotion of Bushido and the Way of the Samurai."
666,1,"A Powerful Message: The Hagakure is a mixed bag for the average reader- some of the contents are life changing and pensive, while others seem very out of place. Overall, it provides an excellent view into the way of life that was the Samurai. It had a profound impact in my daily life, and I would like to absorb more after another time through it."
667,1,"Interesting: I bought this book after seeing the movie ""Ghost Dog - Way of the Samurai"". I didn\'t really know what to expect, but the book has some very interesting aspects on life and ways to live, that still work extremely well in todays society. I have at many times found myself in situations described in the book and even though some answers might be a bit hard to understand, the book has given me answers, or perhaps ways to answer/respond, in different situations. It\'s not really a book you read from cover to cover, but pick up and read a couple of ""rules"" every now and then, which after a while are in the back of your head, ready for use.I highly reccommend this book to pretty much every one."
668,1,"For the Quite Mind: I read this book when it was near/below freezing outside; I sat on a metal bench. I read with such intensity, that I needed the cold to dedicate my mind to the words I was reading. I was often confused by the writings, where I would think about them in great detail until the message became clear. Each paragraph is very important. It is a short book, but it should take longer to read than the Bible. I read it in two weeks, thanks to the cold, but, still, I missed more than I can imagine. Should your eyes miss one word, or a single thought take you away, you need read the passage again and again. This book will change your perspective... change how you view life. It is VERY philosophical, if you concentrate on the reading. I recommend it to those who need change in their lives, those who feel powerless but especially those who feel they cannot control their thoughts. This book is about concentration, dedication and loyalty. This is an important piece of literature!"
669,1,"Hagakure: I\'ve read various versions of ""Hagakure"", and this one is my favorite. Very philosophical and inspirational, delves into the mindset of one whose only dedication is to serving one\'s master and way, in everyday life, and into one\'s chosen path, the battlefield."
670,1,"Excellent Wooden Blocks, Exactly as Described: These blocks are a perfect size for my 1 year old's hands. These blocks have grooves, similar to a tongue and groove, on two opposing sides. The grooves allow for different stacking options and more stable stacking. Quality product."
671,1,"help protect my hairdo: I bought this in the hope that I would not wake in the morning with bed head. You know when you wake up and look like you have a tree growing out of your head.Well the first morning I woke up with a medium bed head, only half a tree so that was heartening. The next morning was the same. Now I am a restless sleeper waking frequently every night- every time I turn over . I guess I cannot blame the pillow protector but the sleeper. Still I am better off than before."
672,1,"Acetate PIllow: I am using it mainly for decoration, i.e. do not sleep with it. So it is holding up beautifully"
673,1,GREAT ADDITION!: Excellent protection. Blends in great with the current rugand upholstery. Should have purchased a long time ago.Well worth the price!
674,1,"Excellent read - brilliant writing: Released in Europe as ""Nell"" (hardback) this is a riveting autobiography of of Nell McCafferty, a journalist and activist from Derry, Ireland who was prominent in both the civil rights struggle in the North of Ireland and the women\'s movement in the Republic. She was a writer for the Irish Times for years covering the justice system and won awards for her series on the Children\'s Court. It\'s a wonderful book... she has a warm, down-to-earth style, somewhat self-deprecating, often wry and witty. But what really caught me was the first person accounts of things like Bloody Sunday and the Contraceptive Train. I was living in Ireland during these years and remember well the controversy surrounding the idea of women working after marriage and having a say in their reproductive rights. Nell McCafferty is a woman of tremendous courage and personal honesty who bore witness to some of the most important events of 20th century history."
675,1,"Owned the 10mm one for 3 years now and still love it: I love this mat. Still sticky, and in great shape after 3 years. Bonus: no nasty synthetic smells.I do take good care of it:It never gets put away damp.I don't use it outdoors.I don't leave it in a locker or unbreathable bag.These are biodegradable mats, so you should treat them with a bit of common sense to ensure that they last (I think 3 years and going strong is pretty good!)"
676,1,Blues Done Right: This is a fantastic CD which features a group of very talented musicians. It is a blues-rock CD with heavy emphasis on the chops of all of the members of the band which features Dave Greenslade and Dick Hexstall-Smith. Not a weak cut can be found on this recording. If you like great blues-rock and phenomenal musicianship buy this CD without hesitation.
677,1,"What does the Government have to hide?: A very informative explanation of a tragic event in America's history. The Author tells of the events that led up to the attack and the horrific aftermath of it. The book tries to tell of the reasons for the attack, although we may never know. Why did the US Government and Israel cover up this terrible event, could the truth be so terrible that the American people would forever distrust the government?The Author makes us realize that if the truth is so terrible, it can be covered up and hidden from us. A call for a Congressional investigation that is honest and truthful is called for and should be undertaken so tragic events like this will never again occur in America's or Israel's history.A great military book and exciting history. Should be a movie!"
678,1,"A Great Book: A great book. The treatment of the crew of the US liberty by the press and the government they served will forever be a dark chapter in US history. Interesting timing of the counter book, this topic was given the blackout treatment for decades until people started comparing it to Sept 11. Now suddenly a book comes out to refute it. Very interesting!Israel never does anything wrong. ... For every event there is a good and long explanation for every major contravesy that shows that israels critics are just big mean anti-semites. Israel is simply never wrong.Israel has long used the tactic of faking attacks by other countries. They think they are so smart and the rest of the world is so stupid that they can use the same trick over and over and over and no one will be the wiser.Read this book and then read the detractors statements it will help you interpret the controlled media's output as well."
679,1,"Disturbing story; troubling questions: Finely told story of the horrifying sudden attack on a US Naval vessel by an otherwise friendly nation. Despite the author's evident anger at the trauma he and his shipmates underwent, he manages to remain circumspect about the ultimate causes of the attack and the lack of followup by his own country's military and political establishment. Ennes makes a compelling case for the deliberateness of the attack; perhaps the whole story awaits a Congressional investigation, one which should have taken place years ago and can still take place if interested readers press for one."
680,1,"Assault on the Liberty: This was extremely well written. I read this cover to cover without putting it down. I couldn\'t believe my eyes. Tears of patriotism rolled down my cheeks. I knew instantly that it was true! Often when the Indians attack and we look for Tonto, he is heard saying, ""What do you mean we \'White Man\'?"" Our leaders left the crew with no support or explaination. The iorny for me was that we were attacked by our own weaponry. We need to know that in these days of world banks and all. The foot soldier is the same cannon fodder he was in the past. Politics?"
681,1,"Hitman is a nastier Norris movie and Chuck's best!: The Hitman gives us a darker more brutal and vile Chuck Norris who is also a very sensitive and moral guy too. He's a deadly vile hitman with a heart! Michael Parkes is in this one too as an over-the-top evil doer who makes other movie bad guys look pale and shoulda got an Academy Award! Really he's that amazing! The combo of a crazed Parkes and a nasty Norris make this violent, and even xenophobic, bloody mess a real gem. This is one fun flick and Norris' best!"
682,1,"A Great Norris Film: The Hitman is a great example of Chuck Norris done right - great actions, great quips, and great supporting acting.In The Hitman, Norris plays a cop who was double-crossed and thought to be killed. He knows works undercover as a hitman for the syndicate trying to to get to the bottom of his betrayal, and trying to stay alive in a turf war between the Mafia and French-Canadian gangsters.Norris is definitely in his element in this film, and his portrayal has the calm, ease, and self-assuredness of someone who acting in a role that would be disastrous for some to pull off. The Hitman is one of his best films by far, and a must for fans of his work."
683,1,"it was very nice: came in less than 3 days, was in the condition the seller said it was in, what more can I say about Chuck Norris, except A. Rey became a damn good actor from Oklahoma, All of his movies are GOOD"
684,1,the hitman: Chuck Norris does his usual dry one liners while kicking butt style of movie. very entertaining movie.
685,1,"Wordpro is the best!: I have used Wordpro since it was Amipro in the early 90's. I also use MS Word because so many documents come to me in that format.I much prefer Wordpro. In many ways, most prominently graphics handling and layout, and ease of text formatting, Wordpro is the better program.This is another example of the better product being outdone by better marketing. Try Wordpro -- you'll never go back to Word."
686,1,Lotus Smartsuite Works with 64bit Windows 7: I refreshed a users computer to an i7 processor and 64 bit Windows 7. User has a Lotus Approach application that is a business requirement. The version I installed on the 32 bit XP machine would not install on the 64 bit Windows 7 machine. With nothing to loose and everything to gain I ordered the 9.8.2 version of Lotus Smart Suite. It arrived in a few days and it installs with no problems and runs the database without any problems.
687,1,Installs onto Win 7 without any problems...: Had upgraded an office computer to Windows 7 and the old machine had SmartSuite 97 installed and a ton of *.123 files. SmartSuite 97 will not work on Windows 7 (at least not without giving you a significant headache) and when I heard that SmartSuite MIL edition worked I thought $30 was a bargain for a headache free usage of Lotus Smartsuite on Windwos 7 - really a no brainer if you ask me!
688,1,"nuttiest nutcracker: my 9 year old is autistic and saw the outside cover of the dvd, thinking it was a ""zucchini birthday party."" so i had to purchase it. now she sees that it is about alot of veggies, celebrating and just loves it. thanks."
689,1,"This one is for the KIDS: I saw the trailer for this movie on a rental and couldn't get it out of my mind. When I went to order it, I was pretty leery of purchasing it after reading the reviews. However, considering its cost and potential use in my daycare, I decided to give it a try. The kids LOVE it. This one is NOT for adults. Many of the children I care for love this movie so much their grandparents HAD to purchase it for them to keep in their homes! Do your kids a favor and try it. You have very little to lose!"
690,1,a fable: This was a great book with great appearance. I strongly recommend this leather bound book to any Faulkner lovers. Blacksea
691,1,"A forgotten classic of Faulkner: It seems every modernist attempted to write a great work concerning the great war (except fitzgerald, who didnt get to go himself). Faulkner\'s attempt may be second only to Hemingway\'s ""A Farwell to Arms."" ""A Fable"" is classic, which won the pulitzer prize,has long been overlooked simply because it represents a change from Faulkner\'susual subject matter. In reality though, it may be his second greatest work behind ""the sound and the fury."" THis work is a brillian anti-war novel that looks at wars affects both on soldiers and civilians, and even on religion. A must read for any fan of Faulkner or modernism."
692,1,Great book: Its a very unknown work of Maslow. I recommend reading it more than once. Gives his last works in his later years.
693,1,Great Burp Cloths: I love these burp cloths! I registered for them before my daughter was born and they have been on heavy rotation ever since (she is now 2). We have not had any problems with falling apart or fraying. I am going to get them as a shower gift for my sister-in-law who is expecting in February. LOVE THEM!
694,1,"Acceptable: These are pretty nice burp cloths, certainly better than cloth diapers. The color of them is different than what shows...they are really more of an organic, unbleached coffee and cream color. The satin ribbon is cute, seems durable. My only con is I wish they were larger, when you drape them over your shoulder there isn\'t much coverage and I am afraid the baby will ""miss"" the cloth. But you can say this about ANY burp cloth...which is why i will buy a bunch of cheap receiving blankets too."
695,1,"Gaddis' The Cold War: In a straight forward analysis that is easy to read and comprehend, Gaddis' study is the definitive literature of the Cold War. This reading is highly recommended for those interested in this tragic period in human history, that was completely avoidable. After a critical analysis of the research, it is agreed that Gaddis is the foremost historian of the Cold War era."
696,1,good: Got what i wanted and in the expected time zone. It was also a great price compared to other places.
697,1,The cold war: Well written book I ever read. Highly recommended for people interested in modern 20th century.
698,1,"A fantastic read: I just finished John Lewis Gaddis' The Cold War and wanted to pass on a recommendation for it. It was enlightening start to finish. Not just about the whos, whats, and wheres, but Mr. Gaddis also touches on quite a bit of political and military theory that I had not really thought about before in this context.I thought it was a great book, albeit a bit short, but that was the point. Mr. Gaddis wanted to put togethor a shorter version of a very complex story. In doing so, he was able to touch on a variety of topics and how they fit into the grander theme of geopolitical history in the latter half of the 20th century without getting bogged down in the details.I think this would be a very good book for beginners but theres something in there for everyone. It may expose you to some things you were not aware of and lead you to wanting to know more about certain subjects. It's a sort of gateway book in that respect, I highly recommend it."
699,1,"A must read for Cold War fans: Anyone interested in the Cold War should definitely get this book from their local library. Clearly aimed at a broad audience, it offers a brilliant account of how ideology and pragmatism affected the decision makers of power brokers and statesmen on both sides of the divide. It also changed my perspective on world geopolitics from a more disengaged and naive view to a more realistic one. A must read for Cold War fans!"
700,1,"a classic not for beginners....: ....but a daring example of the willingness of a thinker to make fundamental changes to his theoretical framework very late in his career. This is where Freud shifts his emphasis from ego vs. id instincts to the famous Eros/death polarity, clinically questionable but archetypally informative."
701,1,"Compulsion to Repeat: Essentially explains why many of us repeat destructive behaviors over and over. This is a short book, but anything but a ""quick read"". Unless you were a psych major it\'s gonna be tough going. But definitely worth the time. Of course Freud was one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century.Surprisingly, recommended for Day Traders, of which I am one."
702,1,"Beyound Psycho-analysim: Freud did a remarkable job of reinstateing, and clearifying exsisting established beliefs, In this his finale publishcation. Although it is a bit wordy on occassions, a even a bit (dare i say) nonsenseacal. It is a enlightning and fasanating piece of work. And though I would'nt recommend it for new-comers to the world of psyco-analysim, it is diffently worth reading."
703,1,"For Your Moon Child: I bought this book because my 2 year old LOVES the moon. It's educational, learning about Native American lore, and is very beautifully illustrated, capturing his attention easily. The poems are short and have a comfortable lilt making reading this book aloud a pleasure. I look forward to enjoying this book for many years as it will appeal to kids in a large age range."
704,1,"Great for Home Lab: This is great for creating a home lab, while more expensive than 3550's, the 3750's have many features that are not supported by the 3550. These switches allow you to use a QinQ tunnel and use the switch as a breakout switch with GNS3 saving you money in the long run (not needing to purchase physical routers)"
705,1,"Perfect replacement: I had looked at these exact replacement pieces at the baby store near me, but these were cheaper. They fit my Medela Pump in style advanced perfectly."
706,1,"just what it says it is: good price, good product and saved me a drive to go buy them, my sister is having her second baby and we gave her back the breast pump which she lend us when we had ours, this is one of the parts which can not transfer from one mother/child to another."
707,1,"medela valves: As always, ever so thankful that I can get parts for my pump. It works hard ensuring that my child is taken care of when I am not there to provide for him myself."
708,1,"Medela Product: Was unable to find parts in Target, Wal mart or even Babies R Us. Found it on Amazon. Good price. BRAND NEW. Shipped fast with another product. Very very very happy. Recommend."
709,1,"Great!: They work great and are exactly as shown in the picture. I recommend this product, as they are the exact same as the original membranes the pump comes with."
710,1,"Dockers Shoe Purchase: I walk to work and home every day. These are great. Took a little breaking in, but now they are fine. Thanks for the quick response. Excellent."
711,1,"Dis-illicited Interludes: A collection of stories about people who are carried beyond the boundaries by their amorous passions, ending with a story of a simple, sweet infraction."
712,1,"This book was very interesting and different to me: I am a freshman in college and Bloom\'s book was really a different type of text for me to read. Many of my fellow students in class were surprised at the book\'s content, and said that ""this is something that one would see on a Jerry Spinger episode"". (the content of the stories) I have seen many of these stories happen in real life so I was not so surprised at the content. I have never read anything about child abuse infidelity and threesomes along with fornication all in one book. Very interesting."
713,1,"Bloom's challenge: How Forgiving Are You?: The characters, on quick glance, may seem crazy, immoral, half-witted; but Amy Bloom's writing and attention to detail stirs the longings we all have as imperfect people, exposes our neurotic, constant need never to make mistakes, and forces us to find compassion for even the most flawed judgement. Ms. Bloom does the impossible: love overcomes infidelity, the nut is the only one who's sane, and grief excuses our mistakes. This book is a rare, precious find"
714,1,"A must-have in my book.: Striking stories. Amy Bloom is a long-standing favorite author of mine. I can still remember the first time I read ""Love is Not a Pie,"" and how long it has stuck with me."
715,1,"A world in each story: Having read her other books, Love Invents Us, and A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You, I think ""Come To Me,"" is Amy Bloom\'s finest by far.Each story broaches delicate issues of life and death, love and loss, and definition of family with humor and humility. Nothing is taken for granted, including the way she carefully chooses each word, each turn in the story.Enter the beginning story with Ellen at her mother\'s funeral in ""Love is Not a Pie."" Watch as Henry and Marie contemplate monogamy and negotiate the confines of their relationship in ""Faultlines"" and ""Only You."" Follow Violet as she watches her sister fall apart in ""Silver Water.""The endings of Amy Bloom\'s stories are surprising not because of shocking leaps in logic or tumultuous events, but because the world in each story unfolds so gently, envelopingly, and it is a jolt when each closes up again, leaving you with the imprint of a world gone as quickly as it unfolded."
716,1,Dog eared and well loved: I've lost count of how many times I've loaned this book to friends (plus how many times I've read it). The stories have the same lasting power as the finish on a good bottle of wine: simple and elegant textures and flavors which linger well beyond the act of consumption.
717,1,"Short stories which are all about intimate relationships: I could not put this book down. I usually don't care for short stories. This book had a real sweet flowing quality to it. All of Amy Bloom's stories in this book are about very human, imperfect people in relationships with each other. At times I found myself actually laughing out loud and at other times I found myself teary and sad. These stories are quite beautiful"
718,1,"An Amazing Collection of Short Stories: Amy Bloom surpasses the majority of modern and postmodern writers in her ability to walk us along the thin line between bliss and sorrow, hope and despair, often tempting us to jump or fall, but ultimately maintaining her course and bringing us to the end where the line dissolves. Her language is sensual decadence for the reader, but her control and neutrality towards beauty enable her to escape the pitfall of sentimentality._Love Invents Us_, a novel which she developed out of one of the stories found here (""Light Breaks Where No Sun Shines""), is certainly worth the read, particularly for fans of this book."
719,1,"Good on tactics: This book was certainly interesting (admittedly a matter of personal taste) and would probably be recommended for the military specialist, rather than the general reader or even WWII buff. The book is essentially a description of German tactics and the tactical situation in the east. It's not really a general history of the eastern war nor an organized, thematic presentation. It is a compilation of essays by Colonel General Erhard Raus (1889-1956), Infantry General Waldemar Erfurth (1879-1971) and Infantry General Hans von Greiffenberg (1893-1951). The essays cover topics of specific military interest on the eastern front, eg. climate, partisan tactics, mud, terrain, reconaissance etc. The book would only be of interest to those with a knowledge, or an interest in the most specific details of combat."
720,1,"Epistle liberation theology: Dr. Elliott makes a wonderful argument for a new reading of Paul. He looks past the screen of history (especially Luther's views on Paul) and allows the context of the 1st century Mediterean world shape the possible intentions of the Apostle. While this book presents solid arguments of history and language criticism, Elliot's conclusions are liberal and might upset people with closed minds."
721,1,"VERY GOOD: I THOUGHT THIS WAS A EXCELLENT CD DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE LEAD SINGER KHAN,HAS AN EXCELLANT VOICE.THAT IS NO SMALL THING NOW THAT MOST OF THE POPULAR HARD DRIVING BANDS NOW HAVE SINGERS THAT CAN`T SING A LICK.GIVING AN EXAMPLE OF BAD BANDS OUT THERE ARE KORN AND SYSTEM OF THE DOWNOR DRONE IF YOU WILL.CHECK THESE GUYS OUT IF YOU ARE YOU ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE SAME OLD BS.THESE GUYS ROCK BUT CAN STILL GET MELLOW.CHECK OUT THE SONG DON`T YOU CRY,GREAT SONG."
722,1,"Buy it NOW!!!!!: What can I say about Karma? This brilliant masterpiece was the only thing I listened to for the 4 months after I bought it and I\'m still not sick of it! I love this album as much as Epica or Black Halo and I want ""Don\'t You Cry"" to be played at my funeral when I die. Kamelot is the best prog/metal band in the world and this is one of their ""big three"" if you don\'t own it, buy it. If you do own it, don\'t ever sell it. A must have for anyone who even remotely likes prog/metal!"
723,1,"WOW: Amazing album, amazing band. One of the best American metal bands that most people don't know!!!"
724,1,"An Amazing Album!!!: A great combination of orchestral and heavy metal. The arrangements are very complex and interesting, not to mention that Kahn is the MAN!My favorite songs would have to be all 3 in the Elizabeth trilogy which is based on the infamous Elizabeth Bathory. Great songs and great interpretations.This was the first album of Kamelot's that I got into and I definitely recommend this to everyone!"
725,1,"KATELAND: Bassed loosly on the story of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy i found this entertaining, but not in the same class as that other wonderful film ONASSIS riches man in the world. I would like to see this film improved on. The quality of it is rather poor not clear and sharp. That is a shame as this has been filmed on the Greek Islands showing us such splendid scenery, the deep blue sea, and displays of colorful garden flowers, white greek buildings. But its in old fashioned full screen and the picture has a blury appearance about it. A REAL SHAME."
726,1,fascinating story: Enjoyable read about the background and life of an iconic American photographer. It was particularly interesting to learn about his relationships with other artists.
727,1,"Great Ansel Adams Book!: If you're looking for a great bio on Ansel Adams, this is the book for you. It is a great, fact-filled book."
728,1,"Brilliant photos, sanitized text?: First of all, the reproductions of Adams\' photographs in the hardcover edition are excellent. The text is designed to relate to the photos, directly or indirectly, without distracting too much from the photos. Adams does tend to lean towards the philosophical towards the end of some chapters, perhaps with a well-founded basis.However, I think it is fair to say that Adams has ""visualized"" himself in a stylized and abstract manner, not unlike his photographs of the wilderness, cropping any rough edges of his life and ultimately contributing to (even propagating?) the myth surrounding his life.After reading his autobiography, I am now looking forward to reading his biography, written by Mary Street Alinder, his editor in the present effort. I hope that she reveals some of the driving tensions and flaws in his life, much in the same way James Gleick filled in the more sombre details of Richard Feynman\'s life that he glossed over in his autobiographies."
729,1,"A Very Useful and Handsome Book: This book has great explanations of the principles of photography, with lots of well-designed illustrations.Also lots of classic photographs from the Time-Life archives. It's a useful reference work, and also a handsome coffee-table book. I doubt I'll ever get rid of my copy."
730,1,"amazing: This book was bought as a textbook for a class, but I will keep it because it breaks down the exegetical process step-by-step and makes it understandable! For me, this book helped to make the exegetical process exciting."
731,1,"Most Helpful Book on Bible Interpretation that I have found: I've read many books on understanding the Bible, from What the Bible is All About by Henrietta C. Mears, which definitely whetted my appetite. To Introduction to bibleical Interpretation by W.W. Klein, C. L blomberg & R. L. Hubbard, Jr. and The hermeneutical Spiral by Grant R. Osborn all of which have helpful ideas in them.But Grasping God's Word has been the most helpful. As a person without a college education this book has led me step by step to understanding and applying the Bible.I especially like the part where they stake you step by step from understanding the likenesses and differences from back then to similar situations in the here and now.Thank you J. Scott Duvall, and j. Daniel Hays for doing such a great job."
732,1,"Grasping God's Word: A Hands-On Approach to Reading, Interpreting ...: This is a good book, fairly easy to read. It gives good examples. It will help you better understand the Bible."
733,1,"Excellent method for Studying The Word of God: This is an excellent book that will show you how to get more out of the Bible than the average Christian ever will. In today\'s culture, it is very important to know how to study the Bible correctly because there are so many ""Christians"" who get things from the Bible that are not really there. This book will show you how to bring meaning out of the text rather than using the Bible to fit a pre-conceived idea."
734,1,"Create slipper for the price: These are so comfortable and warm. The rubber sole is great for quick trips outside, but the sides will get wet easily in the wet grass."
735,1,"Great Slipper: I love these slippers! The are attractive, warm and comfortable. Some of the previous reviews stated they ran small and that worried me but upon receiving them I discovered they were true to size. When you first receive them they fit very tight but after a couple of wearings they loosen up and are a very good fit. Glad I didn't order up!"
736,1,small yes but oh so comfortable!: I wear a size 9.5. I took the info left by others and ordered a size 11. They fit great! Warm but not hot and the this rubber sole means I can let the dogs out without having to take them off.
737,1,"Warm and Cozy: These slippers are just what I needed- something to keep my cold feet warm and cozy. My only criticism is that the toe is pointy, so I had to get used to my toes being a little squished.And definately buy 1 size up. I'm a size 8 and the 9 fits well."
738,1,Excellent: These are great slippers - especially for the price. I did order up a size and was glad I did.
739,1,Shearling Slipper: The International Women's Genuine Shearling Slipper is well made and comfortable to wear. It's rubber sole makes it a secure slipper on wet floors.
740,1,"Tough, comfortable, warm!!: Bought these for my wife as a night-time camp slipper for Colonial reenacting (when the public isn't around). She had a pair from 10 years ago that our 9 year old son wore slam out (...you know kids). Now that his foot is finally bigger than her's I wanted to replace them. As the title says, they are well constructed and tough... conforming and comfortable... and most of all warm. Added bonus is that (at least on Amazon...) they don't cost much either."
741,1,"Very warm and comfortable: I ordered these slippers in size 7, half size larger than my usual size. I wear them when I stay home in winter. They are very comfortable. The soles are not soft and not slippery. I used to buy several other brand warm slippers, this is the best."
742,1,Very Comfy Slippers!: I work from home so I use my slippers alot. And this is the only one not to come apart on me after a few months use. Love it!
743,1,Warm and comfy: These slippers are warm and cozy without feet perspiring. When my feet are warm I am warm all over.
744,1,"Slippers International Women's Genuine Shearling Bootie Slipper: I purchased these slippers for myself, and I am completely satisfied! They are warm,soft,comfortable,and very durable."
745,1,Just as good as the expensive ones! (maybe better!): These are the best slippers! Years ago I bought this brand at an outlet store and loveeeed them so much. While not remembering the name I bought some very expensive pairs of slippers only to be disappointed with the big heavy soles. These are comfy warm and I used to keep my old pair in the car when I got off work for the long drive home even in the snowy midwestern winters! I think they are true to size and they do stretch out to fit your foot quickly. Buy these bargains before they are sold out! I am going to buy a back up pair myself. :)
746,1,"nice and warm: i started to put these slippers on 2 weeks ago, they were bit tight at the beginning, but now are a lot better. very warm and comfortable."
747,1,"Sheepkin Slippers: Excellent slippers. I normally wear a size 8 and order size 9...good thing, in my opinion these slippers do run small. What a bargain. The All Spice color is much like Chestnut. It's a bit darker than pictured. Which is exactly what I wanted. Very happy with my purchase."
748,1,"Does the job: I'm very pleased with this router base, which I attached to a great router table insert I picked up elsewhere for cheap. It allows me to use the fixed base that came with the router for everyday routing jobs without removing it from the router table (this gets tedious). Additionally, the above-table adjustment is handy.Note, though, that you still need to reach under the table to lock and unlock the router for adjustment, so it's not a substitute for a router lift (that would have made it five stars in my book). Still, I consider it a good purchase--it's almost as good as having another router!"
749,1,"great router lift: sofar this router lift has worked great. i like this product, iv used it a couple of times and it has done everything that i needed it to do. i like that here is a router lift for less then $200, its even better thats its under $70. its well made but the only thing i don't like is that there is no way to tell how much you are raising and lowering without using a combination square or ruler. overall this is a great router lift and cant be beat for $70."
750,1,"Absolutely necessary: Not much to say except that the product does exactly what it is supposed to do; the real value is in what it saves you from doing. Having to attach and detach my router's fixed base to the router table each time I wanted to use it was enough of a pain that I sometimes decided against doing certain projects. Now that I have the Bosch RA1165 permanently attached under my wonderful Bosch RA1181 router table, I jump easily and immediately between fixed base and router table use. The Bosch RA1165 looks to me to be exactly the same as the fixed base for the Bosch 1617EVSPK router, without the wooden handles (though there are holes to attach handles), so it works precisely the same as the base I was used to.If you ever use your router off the table, this product is absolutely necessary. Very much worth the low price."
751,1,"Great value!: This is a very valuable addition to my router accessories. It works very well at a fraction of the cost of the after-market router lifts. The lift screw retainer seems to work fine as long as you remember to release the locking lever. I'm glad to know that the drill stop fix is always available as a backup plan if the c-clip does fail. I only had to locate and drill a hole for the adjuster, and then I was making moldings like a pro."
752,1,"Good value: I decided to buy this textbook online and keep it because an anthology can be a useful reference when writing papers. When I get to class I realized that I was able to buy this book new and have it next day delivered to my house using Amazon Student for the same price as most of my classmates had bought a falling apart used copy for. It is important for me to have it delivered because I work full time and take night classes and would never make it to the campus book store before it closed anyways. If you are an English major who actually keeps and enjoys their books, just buy from Amazon."
753,1,"Nice box, needs better documentation: The documention that comes with the router is garbage. The client software that comes with the router is garbage, In fact, the documention and the screen shots didn't match what the router's web interface. Nor did the documentation match the client client software it comes with.Aside from the problems with the documentation, once you figure out Netgear's logic, everything works. Well, atleast everything I've tried. I've been able to set up a client to Netgear VPN connection, and Site to Site. I've also tried all the other features and so far, everything works solid. The only thing I haven't used is the wireless.Over all, I am happy with the FVM318. The only drawback is the documentation."
754,1,"big content, thin book: This book covers so nmuch in a short space. Horses,email, shyness, the feeling of not belonging, the political system, standing up for what you believe in, trust, absent parent and Scottish dance. Whoa, did I forget dealing with a chronic medical condition and ecology? But the book doesn't zigzag all over the place - in fact , all the themes tie together in a way to demonstrate that people aren't always what they seem and that confidence can be created."
755,1,"Up scale magazine: A high class sports magazine. Great articles and stories. Pictures are stunning. Even the ads are eye catching, I will surely renew."
756,1,Amazing tabla guide: This is an ideal book for beginners. It has excellent reference points and is really in depth with the history and evolution of the tabla. This is a must have for anyone who plays or is very interested in listening to the tabla. For instance my uncle is obsessed with the tabla and he found this book fascinating in teaching him new tips and methods. For the beginner this is the real look into Indian folk music. I strongly recommend that you read this book if you appreciate indian folk music
757,1,"A Must Have!: This album is from the heart and perfect to listen to when in that relaxed and laid-back mood...if you like Jimmy Buffet, you must listen to Jose Latour!"
758,1,Did the job!: It has always been difficult to find the perfect DVDs for my recordings until i tried these ones and I've continued to use them with no problems or complaints from my customers.They get the job done for me so I'll keep using them.
759,1,"Good price: i like this shaver because of the price, if it breaks i just throw it away. nice savings and got to love free shipping"
760,1,"Very approachable: This ambitious evolutionary approach to the vertebrate nervous system gives the student all the tools needed to proceed with the advanced (3-volume)works of Crosby, et al (paleo) and Niuwenhuys, et al(neo). The text is well organized and has only a slight amount of redundancy. Would hope the next edition would have improved and possibly colorful figures. This will become the only ""one volume"" classic of vertebrate comparative neuroanatomy."
761,1,"A good product: It was a great purchase, 'cause the book was very well maintained and very cheap. I'm really pleased with this purchase."
762,1,"Fun Halloween movie: This has always been one of my favorites - though possible more for nostalgia than quality. It is slapstick, goofy humor which is fun for everyone, and definitely ok for the whole family. Though it may have some slightly creepy parts, I don't think it is anything inappropriate for a PG audience. The costumes and sets are elaborate and fun to watch."
763,1,"Great comedy: In the first adaption to the big screen of the classic comic strip The Addams Family director Barry Sonnefield do right.First the actors very capable and professional.The fx,costumes and adaptation are also right.A great movie."
764,1,"Brilliant!!!: I love this film, it was my childhood fave, I'm only 14 years old, but I was a fan of the old black and white series because my family watched it, and so I immediatley wanted the films, and I still love them, over 7 years on I adore them...still.I miss Raul Julia's acting skill that he clearly shows in The Addams Family and Addams Family Values.He made the films, but to anyone who hasn't seen these two films, WATCH!!!!!!!!"
765,1,"THEY'RE CREEPY AND THEY'RE SPOOKY..AND FUNNY: One of the few tv to movie adaptations that truly works. Director Barry Sonnefeld (Men in Black) takes the cult fave tv sitcom and turns it into a gloriously filmed dark comedy. Anjelica Huston is marvelous as the quietly seductive Morticia and Raul Julia is perfect as the enamored Gomez. Of course, Christina Ricci steals her scenes as the demonic Wednesday and Jimmy Workman makes a fine Pugsley. If Christopher Lloyd can't quite match Jackie Coogan's Fester, it's more the script's fault than his. Elizabeth Wilson is very good as Lloyd's devious mother as is Dana Ivey as the frustrated wife of nogoodnick Dan Hedaya. I wish they'd have found more use for Vic Mizzy's marvelous tv theme song, instead of MC Hammer's ridiculous rap contribution. But the sets are marvelous and the actors deliver their lines with the straight aplomb that made the tv series so unique."
766,1,"This Movie Rules (Not Unlike Anjelica Huston's Preformance): When I first wached this movie it was right after I wached The Mists of Avalon- long story. I loved Anjelica Huston then (And still do), and wanted to see her in this movie. Well. Exelent choice! I simply LOVE this movie. Everyone thinks that Mz. Ricci stole the show, but I gess that I'm more of a Morticia type. Anyway, the movie is about this family. Not any family, but the Addams family. With Gomez, the man of the house, looking for his long-lost-brother;Morticia, his wife, content helping (And Kissing) him;Wensday, the daughter, staying mysterios and scary, hardly has time to heat up her electrec chair;Pugsly, the son, has only eanough to look astouned when everything happens;Fester, their uncle. Mabey? He appers to be a fake. But, who knows.Grandma, the odd, (Probibly) mentily disabled grandparent.Can they outwit a sly trator? And another sly trator? Ha!!! Watch it and find out. (Though you probibly know already)-An Anjelica Huston Fan"
767,1,"Wickedly Funny! Devishly Entertaining!: I have alway\'s been a fan of The Addam\'s Family TV show of the 1960\'s & when the movie came out in 91 I thought it was just another lousey re-make of an old TV classic. By time it came on video something inside me was urging me to rent it. I did and it was worth every penny I spent, I liked it so much I bought it when I took the movie back.The cast gives suberb performances especially Christina Ricci who, in my opinoin, stole the show from the rest of the cast. Angelica Houston, Raul Julia, & Christopher Lloyd also gave outstanding performances. The story is quite simple, Gomez (Julia) is still searching for his long lost brother Fester. When a greedy woman & her son get hold of the story & hear about the Addams\' fortune she decides to dress her son up as Fester to get hold of the family fortune. Some of the most funny parts are watching Wendsday & Pugsly ""play"" with their electric chairs & butcher knives. A MUST SEE!"
768,1,"Run, don't walk to buy this book!: Okay, I''ve got to admit, I'm not a real fan of Silver Ravenwolf's. I've always found her work to be a little on the frivilous side, but this book is wonderful. It's a solid piece of scholarship, well-done, well-presented, and a joy to read. Whether you're hosting a party, curious about the holiday, Pagan, or mainstream -- i t's a good source of fun and information about Halloween."
769,1,"Great book on Halloween!: Great book with lots of good information about the history of Halloween, myths and superstitions and recipes. Would recommend to friends and family"
770,1,My Favorite Holiday: Halloween is one of my favorite holidays. In here the history of the holiday Halloween is explored as well as the second half is interesting recipes for Halloween goodies. Halloween is actually a neopagan holiday but a lot don't celebrate it because it scares them. Well it doesn't scare me. Finally a book that is a non-condemning tome about the subject.
771,1,"Typical Silver - just plain great!: Just finished this book, the 7th or 8th book by Silver I've read so far. There's a reason I love her books - she has a creative, humorous writing style that keeps the reader interested, and you get a giggle from time to time! Her research can't be matched, the lady does her homework. The history is easy to understand, no gobble-de-gook, yet extremely informative. The crafts, recipes & spells are easy, wholesome fun for the whole family. I wish Silver would write a book like this for each of the Sabbats - I think all of us can benefit from her approach. Definitely a must read, and must own - as are all of her books!"
772,1,Great book: Very helpfull book I really enjoyed it! Halloween is my very favorite holliday and I found the customs and recipes to be a real treat!
773,1,Great perspective: This book is wonderful for anyone interested in the Halloween customs we now observe. Also a little witchcraft if you're so inclined...
774,1,"totally loved it!: I am a huge fan of Silver's. I loved this book, it was fun to read (like her other books,) but also it was well researched, with lore and myth from all over. I really enjoyed it and would suggest it to anyone who loves Halloween."
775,1,Silver reaches people who are not pagans!: The halloween book has made it's way respectively into our public library... even a christian librarian reccomended the book. It's a wonderful tool to show people that witches are not evil hags... and it tells perfectly well how the holiday was twisted into haloween. I reccomend this one highly. For those who would call Silver Fluff... yes she writes on a level that is a little fluffy... but it gets people to open their minds about our faith... and it gets people to think about our customs and traditions in a positive light. Silver should be commended for all that she has done and I hope that the Goddess will keep inspiring her. As for the occult bookstore owner. Would you reccomend the farrar's to a christian parent concerned about what their children are getting into? I wouldn't. This is a perfect book to show them... it is written on a level that is comprehendable... and it also gives good recipes and family fun. -- Blessed Be!
776,1,nice read!: I enjoyed this book very much. It's a history of Halloween with spells and recipes.There's a recipe for pumpkin bread I can't wait to try.
777,1,daylily: Enjoyed the book. Did not know some of the history behind halloween. Interesting enough an Irish play was scheduled in our area and some of the things in the play were also talked about in the book so the play did not seem so foreign to me. Hope you do some more books on the history of holidays.
778,1,"A Wonderful book: Samhain (Halloween) Is and always has been my favorite holiday. It's something about that time of year. Silver's books are pretty good, but I really liked this one. I enjoyed reading about the history of halloween. I also enjoyed the recipes and spells. I think that this is a wonderful book."
779,1,"This is another wonderful work by Sliver RavenWolf.: This book is a complete history of Halloween. It gives everything you need to, or have ever wanted to know about the holiday. I, personally, find all of RavenWolf's books majestic in value, they offer so much advice, this one is no exception. There are spells, divination lessions, and even some magickal recipes, exactly what the swinging witch needs to buff up her magickal party. If you are an avid fan of Halloween, or just looking for a bit of history about our favourite holiday, pick this book up!"
780,1,"What is wrong with you people?: ...You can tell that this book was well thought out and thoroughly researched.Although some of the spells were a bit simplistic, it did have some intresting ideas for ritual and food recipes. It has only 3 spells for love, and it was only for sending love to someone else, and finding love, and she made it very clear not to cast it on a specific person. And the reason why they were simplistic,is becasue I alot of people intrseted in the history of Halloween and Wicca, ma get a little freaked out over serious hardcore spells, while at the same time catering to Wiccans. Although I disagreed with some of the book, like ritaul to speak to the dead, it was pretty good. I have no idea how the spells turned out to be ""half the book"", when there are only about 15 ACTUAL spells out of *200 pages* of otherwise very good, uncommon info. This book is staying in my library."
781,1,Great Info: Likes how the tradition of Halloween came about & what different things mean and represent.The best part is the recipes. That are quick & easy to make.
782,1,Pictures not illustrations: If you are looking for a practical guide to identifying the trees found North of Maryland and as far West as the Great Lakes you should add this book to your library. It is a gem. Even if your focus is in other regions Levinsons methods are practical guidance for the amateur. One comment I would make is about the claim to be an illustrated text. The transcribers note that they replaced the original woodcuts with arbitrary photos of trees or parts of trees. Hence a figure titled Pitch Pine Twig is clearly not pitch pine. Notwithstamding this peculiarity I still rate it at 5 for the merits of Levinsons work and the otherwise high quality of the trancription.
783,1,"awesome indeed: this dvd has episodes 96-119 which personally are the better episodes . this dvd also has subs that are pretty good. the main thing with these ep's they slowly have the espada and them in like ulquiorra and grimmjow.is this item worth buying,i think so."
784,1,"The ultimate manual for relationships!: This book is the how-to manual for coping with a lousy relationship with your mother and how to have a good relationship with your daughter. It covers friendships with women, why women need friendships with other women, the care and feeding of your female friendships and what to do when a friendship ends. It also explores the important role of mentoring. This book is a gold mine! Well worth reading"
785,1,EZ was truly easy: The EZ product was truly easy. I had never change a hard drive before. This was truly plug and play. I would recommend this to anyone.
786,1,Apricorn Ez-Up: I changed my hard drive from 40gb to 80gb in undrer an hour with the Apricorn EZ-Up kit. This is the best way to change a hard drive.
787,1,"Inexpensive & Works Great: Easy to install, cloned my harddrive in 1.5 hours, put new hard drive in laptop, worked perfectly."
788,1,"handy unit: This is a useful device. Without a hitch, I upgraded the HD (IDE) on an older HP laptop. I also used it on a 2008 X61 Thinkpad (SATA); although the process differed, Apricorn had documentation regarding the alternate installation. I certainly recommend this product and appreciate the previous reviewers of this product as they ultimately swayed my purchase."
789,1,"Great product but watch out for the packaging!: I used the Apricorn upgrade kit to upgrade my HP laptop from 60 Gb to 250 Gb. Once I obtained the HD upgrade instructions from HP, I found that it was easy to use. The new HD snapped into the external enclosure without any need for tools. I connected the HD with the enclosed USB cable. I booted the laptop from the included CD and cloned my old HD to the new. Then I removed the new HD from the enclosure, removed the old HD from the laptop (and I needed a Phillips head screwdriver for this), and swapped the two drives. It took about 20 minutes of hands on time and maybe 3 hours to transfer the data. One word of warning, the product is encased in a difficult clamshell plastic package. I cut my finger on the plastic while attempting to remove the product. I would advise that you wear gloves when unpacking the product!"
790,1,"Excellent unit, great disk cloning software, highly recommended: Bought this to swap a 250GB Western Digital Scorpio PATA/IDE disk into my wife's HP DV1000 notebook. The existing 60GB disk was struggling under the burden of digital content that a 10MPixel digicam can produce!As the defacto IT department for my household I'm reasonably technical and there were a few options for transferring the partitions between the two disks, but I value my time and wanted a quick and easy solution.Total time invested in the disk upgrade was 20 - 30 minutes, including reading the documentation. This product really lives up to its name. Cloning the contents of the old disk to the new one took less than 1.5 hours, but once it set off I walked away and left it so I can't be too precise.Two thumbs up!"
791,1,"Cheap But Gets The Job Done Well: I've used this several times in interoffice repairs. It needs a bigger power supply and better connections. This really does work well, just don't bump it during the clone operation. The Apricot Software rocks; It's the best out there I think. This unit is good for one to five drive exchange jobs then its worn out!"
792,1,Works as advertised: The Apricorn EZ-Up-Universal worked just as advertised. I was able to copy the contents of a netbook's hard drive and upgrade it to a 500GB hard drive with no problem. And now the old hard drive stays in the external case for use as a portable backup drive. Excellent solution!
793,1,"Incredibly simple and easy to use: I purchased this kit to upgrade an HP notebook from a 160 GB to a 320 GB hard drive. The QuickStart instructions were all I needed to have the Apricorn perform its mission.One suggestion: before you proceed, set your notebook\'s Power options so that it won\'t go into ""Standby"" mode or spin down the hard disk for at least a few hours. When I did my upgrade, the laptop went into standby every 45 minutes and I had to swipe the trackpad to awake the laptop (the standby mode stopped the transfer temporarily); the process picked up where it left off without problems."
794,1,"Apricorn upgrade package: I got the Apricorn external hard disk housing and a 500 GB hard drive for a laptop upgrade. I simply used the automatic function of the Apricorn software to clone the new hard drive from the drive in the computer. I replaced the old drive with the new one and the computer booted up and ran normally. The old drive went into the housing for reformat and use as an external backup drive. Since the Apricorn package had the software and I had all needed hardware, I got the new hard drive in an OEM package for even more savings. Delivery from Amazon was prompt and there was very little effort involved in the job."
795,1,"Does what it says.: I bought the Apricorn EZ-UP-Universal Kit and used it to clone the 80 GB hard drive in my HP laptop with a 320 GB hard drive. It was easy, intuitive, worked flawlessly and I am very impressed. I did not have to reinstall Windows XP or anything. It just made a perfect clone of my hard drive and I swapped them and the laptop booted just like before but with 240 additional GB available. Wow! Now I have another 320 GB hard drive in the blue box that comes in the kit and use it as an external hard drive. You can do that with the kit as an added bonus. Great software, great hardware. I recommend it to anyone who wants an easy way to upgrade a hard drive."
796,1,Really great. the only to upgrade!: Used upgrade kit to go from 40gb to 160gb HD. Software and hardware worked perfect. In about an hour (10 minutes of paying attention) it was all done. I combined this with a WD Scorpio WD1600BEVS. Also the HD enclosure is built really well. I would recommend this to a friend.
797,1,"Easy as Transferring Music - You'll be glad you did it: Its works Great and it's easy! If you can transfer a music file from one place (hard drive ) to another device ( MP3 player, External hard drive ) you can wheel your way through this in a breeze.It made going to a 160 GB hard drive on my Dell D630 happen in about 1 hour to boot with new hard drive and all old software working properly. THANKS for the timesaver Apricorn.I choose the in windows version. First Load the EZ Gig II software, choose which drive to clone to which and set back. It will actually reboot and does the exchange in a non windows based window. Much like Norton disk doctor if you've ever scheduled a surface scan with the fix errors checked.I'm so glad to have this tool, would use again, and comes with highest recommendation."
798,1,"Works like a charm!: The 20 GB hard drive in my wife's notebook PC was almost full and we wanted to upgrade to a larger drive while preserving all of her programs, data, settings, etc. I did a search and found EZ Gig to be the preferred notebook hard drive upgrade/replacement solution.It comes with excellent instructions and everything you need to get the job done (except the new drive which is purchased separately). It took less than 30 minutes to install the software and hardware, make a backup image of the old drive, start the cloning process, and install the new drive in the notebook PC. Obviously, the copying process can take a few hours, but that can be done at night or on the weekend when the PC is not in use.This is an outstanding product and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to upgrade/replace the hard drive in their notebook PC."
799,1,"Works once you get the correct software version!!!: Product gets a 4, Apricorn Support gets a 1!!This product ships with a CD that is version 2 of the EZ GIG software. It does not work with laptops that have a separate partition for system recovery, but Apricorn support does not have a clue to that issue.Once you get Apricorn to give you the key to the latest version, which is version 8, and create a install cd for it the software works fine.Get the latest version before you start your upgrade. You will save yourself many hours of frustration."
800,1,Great for HDD to SSD: This was exactly what I needed to migrate from my Laptop's HDD to the SSD. It was very easy and the only thing that I would have liked was more control over what I could copy versus just the Document folders
801,1,Real easy upgrade.: This product is really working as what is said in the ads. Upgrading my laptop hard drive was very easy just following simple instructions.
802,1,"easy upgrade for Dell Inspiron 600m: The Apricon EZ Upgrade kit worked flawlessly to upgrade the disk in a Dell Inspiron 600m with Windows XP. Cloning the Dell's 60GB disk to a new 250GB Western Digital WD2500BEVE took about an hour for copying, and a few more minutes to swap the drives. If you upgrade this or similar Dells, you will need to remove the pin adapter from the old drive and put it onto the new drive before inserting the new drive in the Dell drive caddy."
803,1,"Works like a Champ...: I got the Apricorn EZ-UP ""Clone Kit"" to upgrade my laptop.Wow!! This product worked like a champ. It also saved my hide when I tried to mess with partitions on the laptop (went from 40GB to 320GB) to put up Ubuntu Linux (while saving the existing Rescue and Recovery partitions and the MBR) and blew up the O/S (Windoze XP pro). Re-partitioned, and reused the product and viola -- good disk.The product is extremely well documented. This was a totally painless upgrade, very straight forward and most importantly -- it worked first time out of the box!!! I would recommend this product for any laptop HD upgrade!!!!!!"
804,1,Hard Drive Upgrade Kit: The kit worked perfectly. The process took less than 30 minutes from start to finish.
805,1,"Incredibly easy, but iffy instructions: Very easy BUT the instructions didn't work on my Thinkpad T61 with Vista. I hooked up my new 320GB drive via USB and inserted the CD and got nothing. Tried executing the Autorun and still nothing, so I powered off the laptop and rebooted with the CD in, and the menu came up. It took 1 1/2 hrs to copy 130GB to the new drive. All in all, and VERY good experience and I end up with my old 160GB drive as an external USB drive."
806,1,"Pretty awesome product for the technically inept: I bought this to replace my 40GB drive on my Averatec laptop. I followed the instructions the LED lit up, but my laptop would not recognize the 100 GB drive I bought. I was fuuumminggg! I was cursing every living thing near me until I reopened the case and shoved the drive as far as I could into the universal interface. Then and only then did I realize I had not pushed the pins far enough in my attempt to be super delicate with my new drive. Please, save yourself some heartache and ensure the pins are seated correctly. I cloned the drive through Windows and it worked perfectly. Upgrading my HD from 4200 to 7200 has made a great difference in performance."
807,1,"Great item to upgrade your laptop: I have had 2 of these Apricom EZ-UP\'s and both were great (gave 1 to my dad). You can upgrade IDE and SATA type drives with the included USB enclosure case. This kit also includes easy to use upgrade software to clone (copy) the contents of your old hard drive over to the new one. The case only fits 2.5"" hardives or smaller and WILL NOT fit 3.5"" drives. Great item!"
808,1,"Swaping Out Laptop Hard Drives Made Easy: I was little nervous swapping out my wife's computer hard drive. Heaven forbid I lost anything, or it didn't operate as her old one. Directions are easy to understand and the supplied software worked flawlessly. Swapping out the complete operating system, files, and files were transparent to my wife. Her laptop works just like it did before but faster and more capacity. I would recommend this to everyone who ever had thoughts of upgrading their computer's hard drive. Again, extremely easy to use. Just follow the instructions and you will have no problems."
809,1,"Even better then expected!: I bought this to back up a failing hard drive in my 6 year old Dell laptop. It was very easy to use and is very well built. Since it is both IDE and ESATA, I have now used it to back up several other notebooks and laptops. It now functions as a portable hard drive.The software was also very easy to set up and use."
810,1,"Excellent and cheapest Product for cloning Hard Disk: I bought this product to clone my ACER5738-6969 500 GB Hard Disk with Windows. First, the Apricorn Gig II Software won\'t work under Windows 7. I called Apricorn for help. A technical support e-mailed me a link for downloading EZgig2_5197.iso and burning it into a bootable CD-ROM. Following the instruction in the e-mail, pressed the F2 key during powering on, changed the ""Boot"" priority from the internal dark disk to the CD-ROM drive. Then, I cloned the 500 GB hard disk in about 1.5 hours."
811,1,EZ is right: Works like a charm. I used it for a PATA drive and then my son used it for a SATA drive. Makes upgrading drives a snap.
812,1,"Piece of cake: It was very easy to replace my old 20Gb HDD with a new 120Gb drive.For those of you who are not wireheads, let me suggest a couple of things before you buy anything:1) Make sure you know what kind of hard drive you need to buy to replace the existing drive (e.g., SATA vs. EIDE, physical dimensions). It wouldn't hurt to look up the specs of the existing hard drive on the manufacturer's website so as to buy a compatible HDD.2) Make sure you have your laptop manufacturer's instructions for replacing the hard drive in hand.Good luck."
813,1,"A Godsend: My hard drive was about dead, and I couldn't boot into windows. I bought a new drive, under the assumption (duh!) that my Dell laptop had 2 hard drive slots...like most. My plan was to slave the new one and use freeware to clone. Couldn't do that. So, I bought this and it made the whole process unbelievably simple, and fast. Completely worth the money. I highly recommend it."
814,1,"Great Hard Drive Backup System: I bought this to backup my laptop hard drive and it works great for that purpose. It accepts both ATA and SATA 2.5"" laptop drives via a USB cable that attaches the backup drive enclosure to your laptop. The software allows you to select the origin and destination drives, and will size the partitions on the backup drive, up or down, to match the sectors of the original drive. The software can clone your existing hard drive, or selectable sectors. While not advertised, the software can also clone standard 3.5"" hard drives in desktop PC\'s, if you have a backup hard drive attached in lieu of a CD ROM, or to another IDE SIDE motherboard connection."
815,1,"Short and sweet...: This is a short little guide to writing comics. It was originally written in Alan Moore's early days, and then an afterword was added. Basically, in the first 3/4's of the book he goes through the( his?) creative process in a more or less step by step fashion. It is pretty interesting and has a lot of insight. I actually thought is was more helpful than either of the two Eisner books, but I may be a snotty nosed punk (I am a snotty nosed punk so...). The last section, the afterword, takes the rest of the book and stands it on its ear. I was a bit let down by it, but in twenty years I'm sure it will make perfect sense."
816,1,"A Life Lesson..........: There are plenty of reviews on this book and I won\'t try to read them all. I found the manuscript to be quite an excellent guide in the manner that we writer\'s might go about putting a story together. It focuses on thinking in writer\'s terms and at the end you will have a basic idea of how to composite a written work together. Mind you that these \'lessons\', if they could be called that, are based on basic story construction, not necessarily confined to the graphic novel. In the end, however, Alan contradicts his earlier words with what seemed to be a post-written apology, that reeked of \'Lessons from the Frontlines\'....At first, my impression was that if he was going to put this conclusion in, then why did I buy the book and what value did I glean from it? He answers that as well. In a nutshell...""Be original, be creative...keep your audience guessing..."""
817,1,"Classic Juice Newton: Juice Newton holds a special place in the hearts of my wife and myself. Her songs were very much a part of our courtship. Her rendition of""The Sweetest Thing"" has been quite difficult to find in its original arrangement using the pedal steel guitar. Through much searching, I was able to find this CD, ""Country Classics"", which does indeed contain her song ""The Sweetest Thing"" in its original pedal steel arrangement. This piece brings back many very fond memories for my wife and I."
818,1,"Good Quick Reference: Helps with general care plans on major diseases for nurses. Not exhaustive of all diseases, of course."
819,1,"Great Resource: I carry this with me to clinical rotations and have used it for case studies. One of the downfalls is that not each disease is covered as it claims, and had to seek elsewhere for pertinent information. Other than that, it is great to have, and better than the text, which has more information than what is really necessary."
820,1,"Nursing student loves it: This handbook cuts to the chase. As a nursing student I need to write Nursing Care plans before going to clinicals. These nursing care plans need to include medical diagnoses with the pathophysiology of the disease, medical management and nursing interventions; many times these write ups have to occur while I am in the clinical setting itself making using the whole testbook impractical. Being so concise and to the point this handbook really helps in completing the Nursing Care Plans and makes me look like I know what I am doing. Great book, great resource. Highly recommend it."
821,1,"Great for clinicals: Bought this book by accident and now I love it. It is easy to take to clinicals or even to look up different disease process, it has nsg diagnosis with each one also and it is cheap!"
822,1,"ATTENTION MED-SURGE RN STUDENTS!!!!: I am in my second semester of med-surge and I just found out about this bk..it was brand new with the code. This bk is so much better than the txtbk because it has patho, signs & symptoms, treatment, nursing interventions in a short and to the point way..I would definitely recommend this bk..Good luck!!!!"
823,1,"The Most Beautiful Recording Ever Made: I first heard of the Singers Unlimited in 1973 (In Tune With Oscar Peterson was my first encounter with them) and knew that the incomparable Hi-Los were the predecesser of this group. Within a couple of months I heard portions of the Christmas album, but it was a couple of years before I finally acquired it. Having listened to it now for 28 years, I can honestly say that it is simply the most beautiful recording I have ever heard. Not just of Christmas music, but of any kind. The harmonies are just incredible and the voices and the phrasing are perfect. One should listen to this album with absolutely no distractions in order to be able to hear each note of each chord. Although Gene Puerling wrote only four of the arrangements, every single one of the 17 is a gem. For anyone who wants to hear the ultimate beauty that music can offer, this cd is a must. One more little thing. I am Jewish."
824,1,"Happy Memories: I first heard this album on reel to reel at the Guernsey home of my friend Dave Farnon, son of the late great Robert Farnon. What a privilege to hear such fine musicians singing such wonderful arrangements.I was so happy to find that it was still available. This album is satisfying on so many levels, musical and above all, spiritual."
825,1,"Singers Unlimited Christmas: I think that their Christmas Album is better than any others I've heard. Afterall, the acapella sound is much more appropriate than having a lot of instruments interupting the mood."
826,1,"Amazon subscription not as bad a deal as it used to be: While all the older reviews complaining about the price were completely justified, it's worth noting that DWM recently expanded its content - and its price. The cover price is now $9.99, so an extra $1.48 per issue isn't too ridiculous if you currently have to go well out of your way to buy it every month.If you're a Doctor Who fan over the age of 12, it's worth buying DWM instead of the new, cheaper American magazine, which seems to be targeted at kids and is riddled with factual errors."
827,1,"Now there's a new show, do we need the mag?: What a stupid question-OF COURSE WE NEED IT.Look, I can't say if you're going to like the magazine (although if you are a fan you probably will) the best advise I can give is to go down to your local W.H.Smiths (or any sort of shop that sell lots of mags) and buy an edition. If you like it, subscribe-what could be simpler?"
828,1,"It will go with you in your mind...: By far, one of my favorite books for children. I love reading it to my babies. The text with the beautiful pictures will go with you in your mind forever..."
829,1,"A teacher's story: Our elementary school gives a copy of this book to each teacher leaving at the end of a school year, whether transferring or retiring. It is a wonderful book that becomes a treasured memory of their years with us. I was pleased to see how quick and easy it was to order through Amazon.com AND they had plenty of books on hand!"
830,1,Great-Aunt Arizona Is the Best: My Great-Aunt Arizona is an excellent book for children and for anyone who is encouraged by a positive message on education.Gloria Houston's work is wonderful!
831,1,"esto es realmente salsa!!!!: Señores: estamos ante una de las agrupaciones más importantes e influyentes en la historia de la salsa. Un grupo compuesto por musicos excepcionales como Sonny Bravo (hoy en Soneros del Barrio), Jhonny Rodriguez, Nelson Gonzales, Alfredo de la Fe, Nicky Marredo, Oreste Vilato, etc, etc, Y ni hablar de sus cantantes que estan entre lo mas selecto y grandioso de la salsa. Los señores Adalberto Santiago (incomparable), Tito Allen, Jose Alberto el canario y Camilo Azuquita (genial). Este disco es una reunion sobre los 25 años del grupo y de ahi se disolvieron para siempre. Solo quiero decir que este disco nos demuestra como es la salsa dura, la que nunca pasara de moda. Solo para conocedores, no apto para oidos acostumbrados a la salsa sensual o de sonido Miami."
832,1,"Yeow-za!: Whoa! This CD is great! Karen\'s voice is in top form and the songs (like 2nd Chance, So Good, Brand New Day, I\'ve Been Changed) arewonderful! IF you are trying to decide, let me tell you GET IT! getitgetitgetit! If only for ""A Secret Place""! mm-HM! Oh that song is so powerful! It really really is! I really recomend this to you!"
833,1,Love: I bought this for my sister for her birthday and she loves it. This is a very nice CD it came in good time and the songs are very nice as well.
834,1,"Impressed but not blown away: I give Karen her props. She did a good job however, I had higher expectations. She has some great cuts yet some of them were just not - taking me there. I would still buy some of her new albums. I can only give this a 4."
835,1,Great artistry: I have loved Karen's inspiring singing since her first album in 1997. This one is just as good. I just hope that Missy and the rest of the RnB bunch that frequent the latest offerings of the Clark Sisters really do mean what they preach.
836,1,"This is a fabulous CD for babies!: I have a newfound love for Olivia Newton-John!I loved her in the 80's, but thought of her as passe. However, after my sister-in-law played it for my 8-month-old daughter, and it calmed her immediately, I had to have this CD! It is a fussy baby's mom's DREAM!!! ONJ's voice is so soothing, and the songs on this CD are wonderful lullabies. My daughter loves it at bedtime - I put it on, and she goes to sleep almost immediately. What more could a mommy want? It is a beautiful, timeless CD, with songs from all eras! A true beauty!"
837,1,"Sweet and Wonderful: I have always been a huge sucker for a relaxing lullaby, as well as uplifting childrens music. While I don\'t have any children of my own yet, I enjoy providing care for little ones at my church and this is a CD that I would definitely keep in the nursery. The first song - Jenny Rebecca - was the only one that I was not fond of. Being a fan of Olivia Newton John\'s performance in ""Grease"" it was interesting and wonderful to hear her voice in such a ""Warm and Tender"" environment."
838,1,"Vanity Project but great for naptime: I bought this CD based on the reviews. Warm and Tender isnt all that great, its mostly a vanity project of OLJ singing song for her kids when they were little; but you know what? When played at naptime, they work! They are soothing and hummable and before you know it, you can hum along while patting the little ones to sleep. Add it to your collection when you get tired of hearing orchestration pieces, you wont be dissapointed."
839,1,"Simply heavenly: We play this CD for our daughter quite often to soothe her ... and especially when nothing else will calm her down. The music is lovely, Olivia's voice is breathtaking, and we haven't yet gotten sick of it! I highly recommend it!"
840,1,"Sadly neglected achievement: This wonderful album of children's songs, lullabies and standards is now being remaindered for barely more than [amt]. But it's an outstanding album musically and the most personal work Olivia has ever done. It's a shame it got the response it did. That doesn' mean YOU have to miss out on it!"
841,1,"JFK: Do you know who is the 35th America\'s President? How did he become the America\'s President? Why he is so popular?All answers of these questions are in the book ""John Fitzgerald Kennedy: America\'s 35th President"" by Barry Denenberg.Scholastic first plublished this book in 1988.It has one hundred and four pages including with thirty one black and white pictures of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his family.This is a great biography book because it tells the whole life story of John Fitzgerald Kennedy in only one hundred and four pages ,and it has John F kennedy\'s pictures when he was young.So,I would like to recomend this book for people who are interested in biography ,especially,the President of United states of American."
842,1,"The Hunger for Healing: After being part of a hunger for healing twelve step group, I see more of the wisdom of J. Keith Miller's words. I may not always agree with what he says in the videos that are part of the series, but reading them for myself and letting the meaning and how to use that in my own life as needed sink in, helps me in ways I didn't know they would. The book is a great connection to the videos and a twelve step group. - even for Christians who don't think they have any 'problems'!"
843,1,"Great: Excellent integration of Christian principles and the twelve steps. A must read for all Christian alcoholics/addicts. In fact, i believe all Christians can benefit from this book."
844,1,"Best bang for the buck: Starlancer and Crimson Skies are the reasons I bought this game. As a flight sim and space sim fan, I could'n pass up this bargain."
845,1,"Religion in America: The usual series format is followed with pro and con positions on such controversial issues as: Is America a religious or a secular nation? What was the intent of the Founders regarding religion? What effect should or does religion have on American society? Does Christian fundamentalism threaten our freedom? What should be the role of religion in the public schools? Should religious doctrine influence decisions about abortion and traditional marriage? Materials chosen from periodical articles, speeches, and essays covering the entire spectrum from the far right to the liberal left make up the contents. Contact organizations, a bibliography, and index are included as is usual for this series. Even if the 2001 edition is owned, this balanced work should be considered because of the extremely up-to-date information on some very divisive issues that it provides. For teenage readers and adults.Reviewed by Robert A. Silver"
846,1,"Entertaining read, interesting premise.: The previously noted criticisms of the work are accurate, but the book is a very readable piece of work which is not only fascinating, but most importantly entertaining!"
847,1,"Fascinating Sci-Fi Tale: The author, John Cater, who is an electical engineer is a new contributor to Sci-Fi although he has published previous technical engineering works. I picked up his book and was not able to put it down until I finished it. I was very much reminded of the writing style of Michael Chrichten. ""The Endlight Event is a story woven from the fabric of John\'s intimate knowlege of astronomy and resonates with such a plausible premise that some survivalists may start stockpiling their ice-age survival shelters after reading this book."
848,1,"GREAT BOOK FOR TALENT SHOWS!: My elementary school kids have used this book for YEARS to prepare skits for their school talent show, church talent show, and 4-H programs. The skits are easy and most require little speaking which makes it PERFECT for young children... or we adults who can't remember speaking lines! Youth leaders or school teachers would find this book very useful... I have loaned my book several times and am always careful to make sure it comes back to me because this is one that I DON'T want to lose!"
849,1,a book for the ages: Excellent. A great variety of skits that will appeal to and can be performed by kids from 6 to 80+ years old. Many don't require much practice or any props other than an imagination.
850,1,"Wonderful re-telling of Goddess lore: This belongs in every child's library, and most adult ones, too. The writer manages to tell the stories in a way that is interesting but she glosses over some of the sexual aspects of the myths that might be beyond a younger reader's scope. The illustrations are lovely, too. Highly recommended for kids of all ages."
851,1,"War With France: Bolitho is ordered to take his command, the 74-gun ship-of-the-line Hyperion to join Admiral Hood in his attempt to take Toulon. He is seconded, however, to another admiral who has orders to take a small island in the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, it is already occupied by the French. In the ensuing battle, the admiral is killed and eventually he is placed under the command of yet another, in Gibraltar; an old acquaintance--one whom he had once replaced as commander of a frigate--and, unfortunately for his present situation, outshone.This is an intricate story, but easy to follow, with lots of action and excellent character development. After reading a few of these Bolitho books the characters seem to live and breathe.Alexander Kent is surely, as they say on the cover, ""One of our foremost writers of naval fiction.""I hope you enjoy his stroies as much as I do.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"
852,1,Form Line of Battle! (Bolitho Novels): As is the case with all of the Bolitho novels Mr. Kent has written another outstanding tale. This may be my favorite (so far) in this series and I highly recommend this and the other novels for anyone who enjoys books of this type.
853,1,"Captain Bolitho: I purchased many of these novels by Kent in Australia in 1986 but didn't have them all, so I ordered this one to help complete my set. As usual with Alexander Kent and this series it was a delight. Will want to order other novels to complete my set."
854,1,"Slightly different from U.S. made patrol caps...: I'm in the military and will be comparing these to the patrol caps received as standard issue at basic training. I will be referring to these as RC (Rothco) and the issued caps as OI (Original Issue).First, the brim on these RC caps is outstanding. They're firm yet they can easily be flexed to your desired curvature. I could never manage this with the OI caps; it would always tend to flatten out on its own. The velcro on the back is fine. The fabric on the RC caps is noticeably thinner than the OI caps. I prefer the heavier fabric of the OI caps but you may not. But by far, my favorite thing about these RC caps is their fit. I had to give the OI caps constant attention and some serious tweaking every time I put them on just to avoid looking like a combat baker or tactical train conductor. These RC caps require no extra worry and look fine when donned like a baseball cap. This is a big plus factor for me.Hopefully this will help someone out there."
855,1,"Hard to find: This style of Digital camo hat was hard to find. My Grandson wanted it, so after looking everywhere, I checked Amazon [should have known to look there first] of course I found it there. It was sized well, looks good & made of good quality! We received it quickly. This is a very nice looking cap!"
856,1,"Looks pretty real under water!: I really like this plant even though I had reservations after I decided to order it.The colors do not look as good or vivid as when it is out of the water but after you wash it and leave it in the tank for a few days it really starts to show how beautiful it is and how much color, life and dimension it gives to a tank.The tints of burgundy at the tips and in parts of the roots really make the plant look alive almost and help with blending it with other colorful plants you might want to add to your tank.I am very pleased with the quality as well although I would have liked to see the base a little heavier so that it can hold it self a little better under the gravel instead of having to place rocks or a lot of gravel on it so it can stay down.The different shades of green also do not limit you to what other plants you can put in the tank because it almost has all the shades in it so blending is a breeze again.I definitely recommend it and would buy it again."
857,1,"Awesome collection, but...: This is a GREAT collection of Phillip K. Dick\'s earliest short stories. Great writing all around. My only complaint is that there is a very repetitive feel as Dick is obsessed with two topics: war, and ""what does \'human\' really mean?"" If you don\'t mind having the same points driven home page after page, it\'s a winner.J.Ja"
858,1,"SUPER SOFT WASH CLOTHS: THESE WERE THE BEST WASH CLOTHS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, EXCEPT FOR THE BAND AROUND THEM. BUT THEY WERE SO SOFT, YOU DIDN'T MIND THE BAND. UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE"
859,1,"Great CD: Don\'t be fooled by the cover. This CD is great. It has upbeat lyrics and tempo to older songs. I love ""victory Chant"". Great to put you in the mood to praise."
860,1,"The Day the World Came to Town: 9/11 in Gander, Newfoundland: This is one of the most affirming books I have read in a long time. When you begin to doubt the goodness of people, books such as this eradicate all of that doubt. I also bought copies for two other people."
861,1,"an immense story: THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN is a little book with a huge story to tell about that September day in 2001, when 38 jetliners, carrying over 6500 souls (plus a small zoo of animals in their holds!) came home to roost on an island with its own time zone in a land of Good Samaritans, because the world as we knew it had changed forever.RebeccasReads recommend THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN as one of those immense stories from our collective 9/11 experience of how our neighbors to the north took us in & cared for us. It is also the modern global inter-connectedness that glows from Jim DeFede's gathering of the strands of people's lives into a braid of fear, compassion & gratitude."
862,1,Great quick read: It was great to read a book about 9/11 that had a positive spin. The description of the town and characters makes me want to visit Gander Newfoundland someday.
863,1,"A love Story for all Nations: Teachers take note! This is a must read for all future leaders. Jim DeFede tells the reality of people coming together to be ""in the moment"" during a very difficult moment.Clergy, this is a must read for religious studies!This is a how to book for adults -- how to turn evil into good, how to step across politics, religion, take down the borders that separate us and take charge, how to work for peace.Parents, a family read! Young and old, children, women, men and animals, every one is counted and made to be accountable for making life go on!A fine gift book --Heart warming sincerity at its best!"
864,1,"A fresh new twist to the catastrophic events of 9/11: A light during a time of darkness. When a small town opened its doors and its heart to the passengers stranded when the United States closed its airspace. During a time of utter uncertainty, the residents of Gander, Newfoundland were giving tours, cooking, providing warm showers...in essence, the people of Gander were treating complete strangers as family. Friendships were made and the makings of a great story were formed. Jim Defede did an excellent job capturing the soul of Gander in this book and as a passenger that was stranded...I can say that in a time of extreme uncertainty...Gander rose up and made us all proud to be Canada\'s neighbor. Read this book. We could all learn a valuable lesson from it. During a time of ""good vs. evil"", Gander fought the silent fight and made \'good\' the victor."
865,1,Heartwarming: This book restored my faith in humanity. I got sucked in to the stories of each of the characters and found my emotions to follow what they were going through. This book was a quick read and made me hope that someday I am able to visit Gander.
866,1,"Strangers became families: At a stressful time in recent history,strangers found caring families in Newfoundland. An accounting filled with warmth,laughs and sorrows as people from around the globe are diverted to Gander, Newfoundland on 9/11"
867,1,"Nice, Quick Read: This book was very interesting and entertaining. It was amazing to see what wonderful, caring people there in Ganderland. It was a moving story about a very sad event in our history."
868,1,Mostly unknown story of 9/11: The world was focused on NYC and WA DC on 9/11 2001. I personally had never heard the story of how Newfoundland played such a great part in helping those marooned because of the flying bans over the US. This is a intriguing and touching story.
869,1,Heartwarming!: A truly amazing account of a tiny town which opens its heart to help those people trapped during the aftermath of 911.If only more people were like this!
870,1,"A great fresh treatment of some classic American music!: Mr. Traina has done it again- assembled the very best talent on the New York scene for a recording that captures a great spontaneous feeling of swing, and does so with authority. Joe's playing really shines on this outing, and trombonist/vocalist/arranger Pete McGuiness' work is outstanding throughout. Catch the Traina band live in NYC if you have the chance!"
871,1,"Johnny Philko-Songs to Swear By: Johnny PhilkoRockSongs to Swear ByWhenI first heard the music on this album I was excited to hear the whole thing; strong guitars, awesome drums...then I heard the vocals. I was caught off guard by this new sound I heard. It was totally unexpected, but you can bet it's a voice I'll never forget. Johnny Philko's vocalist is like nothing I've ever heard. The best track on the album is One Stormy Night. This song is an instrumental. The next song I liked most was Stray Dog Stagger. It's lyrics are catchy. There's a songfor everyone on this album.I rate this Songs to Swear Bya 4. It reaches its goal and then some."
872,1,"Very cool!!!: This is a very cool cd. I love the vocals and the guitar playing is very very good.I happened to catch one of their live shows and was blown away. These guys rock and they really know their stuff. I got one of the cds right away.The cd focuses on real issues of concern. This is not you typical pop-rock sickly sweet candy coated rock.Songs to check out include One Stromy Night, Waco, Ruby Ridge, and Stray Dog Stagger."
873,1,"Great Rock & Roll: Great music with a message!! Love the CD. See them live sometime.""Civil disobedience is the inherent right of each citizen. He dare not give it up without ceasing to be a man. Civil disobedience is never followed by anarchy. Criminal disobedience can lead to it. Every State puts down criminal disobedience by force. It perishes if it does not. But to put down civil disobedience is to attempt to imprison conscience."" - Gandhi"
874,1,Little Guy Loves It!: My little guy is always so excited to get back home to play choo choo train. He is 2.5 but even his 6 y/o cousin loves to play it. This is not the most highly advanced set but with imagination you have an airport/ heliport and trainworld- and all the other toys have joined in too!
875,1,great value kids love it: my 3 year old and 5 year old granchildren love it. it was nice to know how to aadapt with other locmotives.(thomas). the vendor BLessings was very helpful and let me know when they were going to sahip and wanted to be available if needed. This was so much less than Thomas and well contructed and lots of different play areas for them to use their imagination. they even had a tornada do through and had to rebuiuld. Great product. LA
876,1,18 MONTH OLD LOVES IT: Our son loves trains and we decided this year we wanted to get him a train table after watching him play with one in a store. We were a little resistant at first at what to do since he is only 18 month and it does say choking hazard. The set is really nice for the price. it does come with smaller pieces but what we did was we left the items that he could choke on off the table and will save those for when he gets older. he really loves the train and it comes with a plane and helicopter and the grandparents bought a few thomas the train extras to go with it that attached great with the set. i really recommend this table i also love the storage and the table was a breeze to put together at 10 at night and the instructions were easy to follow. two thumbs up.
877,1,Buy Buy Buy - if you have a boy over 2 years old!: Santa Claus brought this for our son this past Christmas and he has played with it almost everyday for at least an hour a day. The toys / trains themselves are not fantastic but they easily accept the Thomas train series (and are interchangeable). We have also purchased some BRIO parts and they have also worked. The height is perfect for 2-3 year old. For the value - this is great.
878,1,"Great for price: I was very pleased with this purchase. For the price I paid ($119.00) I am very happy with what I received. There were a couple of things that I was disappointed with which are listed below:-Bridge wooden piece was broken where the rail connects and rests on. I was able to glue it back. Two of the eight screw holes were in the wrong place, but it is stable enough without them.-Water fall looks like it had sounds, but there was no electric component. I remember reading about it on another review, cannot remember if you can ask for a replacement.-When I was putting the board on the table it rubbed against the side and started to peel back the cover. I just taped over all the edges and it looks fine. Some of the pieces it came with are cheap, but both imaginarium and thomas the train toys work well with it."
879,1,"Great value for the money.: Easy assembly. Far more extra buildings and accessories than we expected. A nice bonus. Our 4 YO grand daughter loved this gift and plays with it constantly. How it hold up over time, only time will tell. We're hoping it makes it to be used by her baby brother when he is old enough."
880,1,Nice table: I shopped around and looked at a lot of train tables and picked this one because of the unique storage. It comes with three storage bins and they do hold all the pieces in two bins so you have a third one for whatever other toys you buy to go with the table. It is kind of big so it has to sit in the middle of the room so he can reach all the way around it. He loves it so much and his older sister (6) and Brother (12) love to play with it too.
881,1,"High Quality Train Set: We bought this train set for our kids for Christmas and they both love it! The height of the table is good (about 16-18 inches) and the set comes with a ton of pieces (train cars, stop signs, bushes, etc). I feel like it took me just as long to put together the actual train tracks and the small helicopter pad and crane as it did to put together the actual table (about 90 mins or so for each --- though mind you I'm not terribly handy). The storage bins underneath get caught up a little bit when you try to slide them out but overall they are useful to have.We also purchased a Thomas and Percy car separately and they both work nicely on the tracks.While this set seemed a little pricier than some of the others we came across, the quality seems to be very good. The trains seem to roll very easily on the tracks and the kids are having a great time! Overall, I would highly recommend this train set!"
882,1,"Good product: Good quality product. I had no problem putting all parts together. Assembling it was a fun, because my son was helping me.Few complaints: I wish magnets were more stronger to keep train cars together and table surface should be water resistant.My kid spills drinks all the time on the table and it leaves spots, even from water."
883,1,My daughter loves this sturdy set: This train table set is compatable with many others. I bought this table based on reviews and I am pleased with this purchace. My daughter plays with this table everyday. Great buy! It will last for years to come. We also have thomas the train sets and it all connects well as an addition.
884,1,African Jazz...: The tenor saxophonist teams up with producer Bill Laswell to create an album I would best describe as African Jazz. It hits some fine grooves and there is always something interesting going on under the surface.
885,1,"Top 5 of the 90's: One of the best jazz albums of the 90's with: Sonny Sharrock, Highlife; David Murray, Shakill's Warrior; Ornette Coleman, Tone Dialing & Graham Haynes, Transition."
886,1,VERY Nice!: This is nice light. It is extremely visible from far away. It also clips onto the topeak bag I own. It is very convienent to just clip on and remove it from the bag. Thank you for a wonderful product.
887,1,"Mature ladies! Score this wonderful stuff!!: For a comparatively little price, you can give yourself a bit of that youth ""glow"" that used to come naturally. Use a tiny dab of Revlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener wherever you want that shimmer to accent your features. Voila!The effect of Revlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener can be subtle enough to use in bright sunlight, but with a little extra application, can create a more dramatic look. If you\'ve been after that subtle ""glitter"" look that you\'ve seen in fashion magazines, Revelon has most definitely got the goods!"
888,1,"good product: I hate the feel of most foundations and this product works really well and gives life to middle age skin. Unfortunately Revlon is no longer making it so is no longer available. So happy to get some before your supply was goneRevlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener, SPF 15, 04 Bare Light, 1.5 fl oz (44.3 ml)"
889,1,"South Park is Awesome!!!: This is a good DVD to buy. It starts out with ""Conjoined Fetus Lady"" which is pretty funny. I love the part where the Chinese people make fun of the americans. Overall its a pretty good episode.The Next Episode is ""The Mexican Staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka"". Its a very funny episode, especially when it goes back showing Jimbo and Ned in Vietnam. Overall its an OK episode.The Next episode is ""Flashbacks"". The first time i saw it i loved it, but the second time it wasnt as good. If you havent seen this episode before you have to see it, its hilarious!The next episode is ""Summer Sucks"". Its a funny episode but not the greatest.If you\'re a south park freak (like me) you should definitely buy this one. But, there are others that are better than it. But if you collect them, definitely get this one."
890,1,"Fine, cheap - but worth the price.: These are made from pressed, waffle-punched, steel. Pretty rigid and reasonably protective. They come with a soft/stretchy vinyl-rubber ring around the mounting ring edge, which you can easily remove. But, this leaves a sharp waffle-shaped irregular edge. I would think this grill is pretty difficult to mount on anything from the front. Even mounted through an 7"" hole from the back, the irregular waffling at the edge did not give me an easy 4 equidistant points to put screws through.However, I made it work for me, and it is far, far cheaper than other grills."
891,1,"Psych Book: I bought this as a possible textbook for a Christian-based highschool psych class. It is an excellent resource, well-written, but it was too technical for my needs. It is great to have as a reference."
892,1,"Great book for homeschooling psychology to high school: This is a fine book to use for homeschooling psychology to the Christian high schooler. The teacher will need to assign essays or book reports, as there are no ""questions and answers,"" but it covers the info for high school or beginning college understanding of psychology pretty well."
893,1,"Gotta love the Mechs.: Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers wont be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right."
894,1,"MW4 black Knight rocks: This game is the bomb the new mechs are the coolest the sunder and royoken and black Knight rock!The new wepons just kick but like Ultra AC 20, X pulse lazer, cluster bombs and all wepons have a clan vesion!The missions are harder you have to kill the people you had in the last game. So you should buy it!!"
895,1,"Just as good as MW4: I have only one thing to say, excellent game microsoft. All facets of the game is well done. Peace:"
896,1,"I LOVE BK: BK is the greatest game ever, It has more features,Mechs etc... than the orginal Mech's Warrior Game."
897,1,"Sega AM2 Arcade Greatness: This is updated from the PS3 release. PS3 was ver B, the Xbox 360 is Version C, the latest version in the arcades in Japan.enhancements: cleaner looking graphics than the PS3.ONLINE play and features. (HUGE!)Version C video introduction.Other Version C arcade features? Character item customization...RUMBLE support.Online play and graphics and Version C make this a must buy for VF and Sega Arcade fans.Excellent fighting game, and in high definition and 5.1 sound!"
898,1,"Worth Buying: I have been playing Virtua Fight since the first game and I say this the best in the series,it does take time to master it but it is worth it, all the acheivements are all offline so you can spend time in training.my only issue with it is the online, if you want to switch characters,you or the other person has to back out change characters then have the person invite you back to play.So if you don't mind that then grab the game"
899,1,"I give this game an 8/10: This game is fun for anyone who can move their fingers a lot faster than mine. I couldn't get used to the ontrols too much either. and the special moves are hard to pull off when you have to move your character at Sonic speed. I wouldn't buy this game again, good thing I traded this in along with Outrun 2 and Outrun 2006."
900,1,"Fight Online: the game play is great the graphic are very good the best i have ever seen but one thing that i hate about it is; that it is to hard to master the more complex combos,but it will take a person that has no life about a week of non stop play to master it. i recommend this game, you will not be disappointed."
901,1,"Best Picture Hanger I have used: Very easy to use, and the wall dog anchors are quite strong. A must buy if you want level hanging and/or reassuring strength."
902,1,"Excellent hanging system!: We own a beautiful and unique 100 lb, 5 ft x 4 ft mirror. We attempted hanging it with picture wire and multiple mirror hangers. No success. The hooks ""groaned"" and then tore out of the wall leaving ugly holes. Welcome the HP-30 Heavy-Duty Mirror and Picture Hanger. It installed easily and is supporting our mirror in style."
903,1,"JWs lost people like most of my family: Most of my family, sadly are JWs. It's a cult, I've experienced racial hatred (of Africans), sexual molestation, propaganda, etc. I've heard of rape (an elder raped a lady while he was in service supposedly). JWs predicted the end of the world at least 7 times, even the leader is buried in an Egyptian pyramid in Pennsylvania, with Masonic symbols on it. I'm not saying Egyptology or Masonic movement is bad or good, but if JWs today say it is, then what does that say about their leader? It's a cult that makes billions of dollars each year off the brainwashed members. So sickening."
904,1,"Looking for ASV - can anyone help?: I read the comment by the reviewer from Montgomery, Alabama back in September that the ASV would be available from Star Bible in November. I can find no information about Star Bible and the ASV still appears as ""out of stock"" or ""out of print"" in all my searches on Amazon. Can anyone help me find a source for a printed copy of the ASV? If so, please respond here or email to nathancci@hotmail.com. Thank you very much."
905,1,"Great Bible, but there\'s a less expenseive version: It is always nice to have several versions of the Bible. Each translation gives you a different perspective. Why only 4-stars? I prefer the ESV and the Message.I noticed that this is described as the ""ONLY ASV"" actually it is not -- there is a new paperbackThe Holy Bible American Standard Versionfor $29.99. The two 1-star reviews for this are for the Kindle edition, but a different publisher.Be sure NOT to buy the Kindle version!"
906,1,"ASV 1901: Very nice. It was what I had expected. It is bonded leather, but it is nice for Bonded leather, Not too stiff. as some is. The type is small, but dark and readable. This is a specially Bible and not for most people. More of a collectors Bible or for some one who likes to dig into antiquities, as I do. I am proud to have one, but it would not be many people's cup of tea in 2011. If you are looking for a good reliable, easy to read and understand Bible for today, the NASB or the ESV would be a good choice. It would have been nice if it had been printed and bound by Oxford, Cambridge or Allan Bibles in Scotland. What a nice gift that would make...Goatskin leather, sewn binding, clear type..sweet $125. !"
907,1,"So glad I found it: My ASV, that I have used for years is wearing out. This is the version that I grew up using. It is reported to be the most literal English translation. Though I have used the NASB and the Good News, I prefer The 1901 ASV. It is a Bible for serious Bible students. I do have this translation on my Bible software, but one can't carry it around to use at Church and other studies."
908,1,"American Standard Version (1901): This is the most literal translation of the Holy Bible in existence. If one wants to read the Scriptures in the English form closest to the original manuscripts ... this is the it. And by the way, it is NOT out-of-print. Star Bible began republishing the ASV as of January 2000. It is available in both hardback and leatherbound ... and includes both the Old and New Testaments."
909,1,"Only ASV published: This is the only American Standard Version Bible currently being published. It is a reprint of the original Nelson and Sons of 1901. Star Publishing has done an excellent job of bringing back a forgotten translation. The below reviewer seemed dissapointed that it didn't measure up to a genuine leather Oxford Bible. I've been selling Bibles for years and this Bible is of the same quality of any other $60 Oxford Bible. Of course it doesn't compare with a $150 Bible, but you're not paying $150. For the money you won't be dissapointed and you will be able to add a new ASV to your translation list. They also offer the ASV in hardback."
910,1,"Subarashii, ne. Fantastic!: I was delighted with the purchase. It arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition. I haven\'t stopped listening to it since then. It brings back such wonderful memories. ""Totoro"" is my favorite character, and I love the soundtrack for that movie, but the songs from ""Kiki\'s Delivery"" just fill me with a child like joy. Thank you so much. Doomo arigatioo gozaimasu.Footnote: I have been searching for an old Japanese ""soap opera"" called ""101 Proposal."" It is about 18 years old. I, also, had one of my Japanese children\'s drawing books stolen from school. It was part of a set. I do not know the name write now, but I would love to replace it. I don\'t know what your contacts are. Doomo. Thank you."
911,1,"This CD is spectacular!: As you grow up the movie itself can seem dull at times, but the soundtrack never wears thin. It gives you a feel of being at an Italian Cafe...or maybe France...or maybe the Mediterrainian. Either way this CD is worth the price. It arrived in a short time for me and I can\'t get over track 2 - ""Departure"", the feel of being at ease... and then the witch music... and then all is peaceful again. In short, I reccomend this CD for any Miyazaki fan or as a nice present to your now grown daughter who watched this mocie so long ago...you\'ll see smiles. Best of luck in your purchase."
912,1,Great book - interesting subject: Very good approach to the subject. The book can be read from everyone either from people with mathematical and computer knowledge or people from finance and business domain. Excellent work!
913,1,Read this book when I was 10 years old: I read this book in 1973 when I was 10. I cried while reading it. I lived in a Christian Home for Children during the time. It made me take a different look at my circumstances to know that someone had it so much harder than me and caused me to appreciate where I was & all that I had at the time. I was so worried for the girl in the story the whole way through and my imagination took me to where she was on every page! A.N. where ever you are I wish for you a kitchen with the sun shining through it every morning! God Bless.
914,1,"Nice, good old songs to enjoy!: I was pleased to be able to hear some oldies & goodies sung by this terrific lady. I give it a 2 thumbs up review!"

916,1,"emporio Armani mens colgne: Such a wonderful cologne. It makes the person smell fresh, and clean, yet sexy and young. The price of the Emporio is not to bad, and it is sure worth it. I have had my man use it for a very long time, and will keep using it. I would recomment this to anyone..thank you"
917,1,Native American music: It is becoming very hard to find genuine music of any kind. I watched XIT perform this album on the Documentary Channel and was immediately hooked. Excellent music that pulls no punches.
918,1,without reservations: This is a suberb album with some of the most heartfelt songs in the world on it! My dad left this to me and I love it!
919,1,"New SAVOY BROWN best in years!: First let me say I am a huge Kim Simmonds fan and would buy anything to hear his playing, especially on slide. Imagine my utter delight to discover he is now handling more of the vocals (and not too shabbily either) and surrounding himself with the best band line-up in years. ""STRANGE DREAMS"" is the best from the reincarnated Savoy Brown in at least a decade not including Kim\'s fine solo albums which I highly recommend. My favorite song is ""Memphis Last Night"" because of the fine solo by Kim. All of the songs are first-rate. Not a bad one of the lot. Buy this CD. It is the one Savoy Brown fans have been yearning for for ages! Now get to work, Kim, on another fine acoustic solo album! Albums like this may yet bring the Blues back in vogue. Here\'s hoping!!!"
920,1,"Keeps on rolling.: The latest release from Kim Simmonds and Savoy Brown is a tasty sample of what this band is capable of. The songs are mid-tempo blues and can best be described as being performed by accomplished musicians who are comfortable with the material. There is maturity and confidence in the playing that is like the difference between making love and getting some. As always, Kim Simmonds\' guitar smokes, and the band is a sympathetic companion.Kim Simmonds handles all the vocals on this release and he as never sounded better as a singer. His voice has taken on a fuller sound and is very appropriate to the material. All of the songs are good, although, ""Keep on Rollin\'"" deserves a special mention, because it could be Simmonds theme song- The chorus states- ""I\'ve got my troubles, but I\'m gonna keep on Rollin\',that certainly has been how Simmonds has stayed in the music business for the last 30-some years, and how Savoy Brown continues to release worthwhile material like Stange Dreams."
921,1,"An Incredible Journey: This book is one of the best you\'ll read this year, guaranteed. It\'s a glimpse into the former President\'s youth, a life which was never easy, but never one that was complained about. Rather than writing a diatribe railing against growing up without having been born with the silver spoon found in so many of the other Presidents\' mouths, Mr. Carter explores and celebrates the small trials he faced and which, eventually, molded him into the man who became President. ""Angela\'s Ashes"" as written from Georgia? Why not?This book makes an outstanding gift, if only to yourself!"
922,1,"A thouroughly enjoyable book: Even if this book was not written by a past President, it would be a great read. For an urban Yankee like me, this story of a rural Southern boyhood was fascinating. It's hard to imagine a boy who grew up barefoot and worrying about being able to handle a plow becoming President of the United States. His style is easy and warm. There are lots of interesting stories about share croppers, race relations, farming, and things I have no way of knowing about, thus it gave me an insight into a culture totally different from mine. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!"
923,1,"A Joy to Read: Not since I read (on April 11, 1986) Russell Baker's Pulitzer-prize-winning Growing Up has there been a book of this genre which has so moved me. I spent a rural boyhood myself, but I cannot say it was as rich and varied and interesting as Jimmy Carter's, and it was not spent in Georgia. This is a very pleasant book to read, and you will never regret spending a little time reading this well-written book, full of insight and nostalgia. I hope it wins this year's (or next year's)Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, as Russell Baker's delightful book did in 1983."
924,1,"A delight trip back in time: I picked this book up at the thrift store and loved it. It really gives honest and charming insight into the boyhood of President Carter. I was pleasantly surprised. A loving and strict up-bringing with a tremendous amount of physical freedom - ideal for a young boy. Also a fairly detailed picture of life of the farm, all of the ups and downs, certainly not a bed of roses. Highly recommend."
925,1,"Beautifully Written: History Comes to Life: At the risk of sounding ""ethereal"", there is a definite peaceful energy that pervades this book. I don\'t know how that ""gets into"" a book, but it did. I loaned this book to a colleague and she mentioned the same thing without any prompting from me. In any event, if you enjoy history, then you will like this book. Carter paints a vivid picture of rural American at the time. The stories are charming, vivid, and interesting. I have read a few other books by Jimmy Carter, but this is by far is best."
926,1,"good: exactly as described, worked perfectly, great communication would recommend purchasing from this vendor if anyone is considering this type of purchase"
927,1,Several good tips.: There are several good tips here but some are outdated since it deals with film and developing. But still you can get some inspiration here.
928,1,"Practical and Great Learning Tool: Unlike most other techniques books, the techniques shown here are very practical and easily tried out, with the f-stops, FL and shutter on every photo (unlike many other books). Most of the techniques you will ever need are included, and more. Well served as a field guide too, it's fairly small to tuck into the camera bag.Excellent writeups and light-hearted reading, so good it's one of my most often read books. Not much of a coffee table since the images are fairly small. Another excellent book from Lee is Night and Low Light Photography, a seldom touched area of photography."
929,1,"Excellent but a little bit outdated: This is a very good book, provides very detailed instructions how to do some tricks. It has plenty of superb illustrations, so everything is great. There is just one but. A picture taking techniques part is still very valuable, but most of special effects and image manipulations now can be done much easier through digital processing. If you want to add grain to your picture it's so much easier just to scan it and use software then mess with reprints, special contrast materials and processing etc."
930,1,"Great book for teaching photography: As a photography teacher I had one copy of this book and have used it periodically throughout the years for suggestions with assignments. Now I will be teaching an adv. photo class and have ordered one for each student as a kind of text book. This book give a 1-2 page detailed but to the point description of a technique without all the blah blah blah that other books can waste your time on. It tells you the film to use, the apertures, shutter speed, any extra equipement and shows you color photos all on 2 pages. It is an EXCELLENT reference book."
931,1,Perf: This album was so good that I HAD to buy it which says a lot about this album because I don't buy albums often anymore.
932,1,"Great read: I discovered this book when I lived in London about ten years ago and always end up re-reading it around Thanksgiving of every year. It\'s the story of 6 friends who rent a beach house as an indulgent year between college graduation and facing the ""real world."" When one of their number discovers he has terminal cancer, it forces the others to face up to their futures and their lives with each other and without one of their own. A brilliant book that I highly recommend!"
933,1,"Inspirational guide for balancing your life.: Draws upon the Tao Te Ching and the practice of aikido to illustrate a balanced approach to life. Includes chapters on transforming challenge and conflict into harmony, respecting the natural cycles of life, and overcoming feelings of powerlessness in order to find a more active, powerful approach to life. I've been curious about the martial arts and really enjoyed the parallels the author makes between spiritual growth and aikido. Gave me a new perspective on the issue of balance."
934,1,"Wow I miss this book: This is a wonderful, wonderful book. I'm not quite sure what else to say about it since it has been so long since I last read it. It was a book highly conducive to midnight epiphanies, and really helped frame my search for an effective way to live and understand my life."
935,1,another succesful amazon order: another succesful amazon book order for me...seems to be the sure way to go when looking for hard to find books at great prices
936,1,"One of JCY\'s better efforts: Jesse Colin Young turned out several solo albums after his days with the Youngbloods, most of which were forgettable. ""The Highway is for Heroes"" is an exception, an excellent album presenting his sweet voice at its best. ""Sweetwater"" is a close second, including a fine rendition of ""Darkness, Darkness."" Buy these two disks, and you will have the best of JCY."
937,1,"Great book: This is the very first book that I read completly, I was a very young preacher and It really help me and still helping me in my spiritual life."
938,1,My son's favorite pacifier: This is my son's favorite pacifier. He's 17 months old. He loves it and we always get compliments on it.
939,1,"Your baby is going to get all the looks: Everyone looks twice when they see the pacifier and then laugh. It's great if you want to draw attention. Anatomic, my two year old is still using it."
940,1,"""People Time"" is a great swan song for a great player.: Although, as stated in previous reviews, Stan was battling lung cancer at this time, ""People Time"" is that much more poiniant and amazing for it. Stan is playing straight from the soul, and Kenny Barron plays brilliantly. In a duo such as this, someone needs to set the tone - and both players do a magnificent job. Recorden in Sweeden, the audience knows exactly what variety of genious they are witnessing, and again, being LIVE, the stakes and the history are always boiling under the surface. Stan\'s renditions of ""East of The Sun..."", ""I Remember Clifford"", ""Surrey..."", and ""Stablemates"" are my highlights. I simply can not get enough of this one, and I go to it time and time again. A real classic."
941,1,"Final Stan Getz Live Performance: Since I have been a longtime afficinado of Stan Getz, and own many of his cd\'s, I decided to purchase this ""People Time"" 2cd set of Getz andKenny Barron. As it turns out, this is Stan Getz\'s last Live Cd performance, since he died several months later in 1991.The performance of both artists is very good, and it makes me appreciate the tenacious qualities of Stan Getz over his five decades of work.The service provided by the Seller was excellent and I would definitely utilize them again."
942,1,"Essential jazz.: A live recording of incredible clarity - a conversation between friends - patient and thoughtful. It is Getz\' last. There is gorgeous air in his tenor. Kenny Barron has a light and often lively touch on piano. The ballads are especially beartiful and moving. Try listening to ""First Song"", a Charlie Haden composition, while you read Kenny Barron\'s liner notes. This is sad and soulful stuff."
943,1,EXCELLENT!: These are very good & super fresh. Highly recommended for any & all nut lovers. The salty & sweet plus the perfect crunch make these hard to beat.
944,1,THE BUTCHER'S WIFE: DEMI MOORE was great in this movie..She is an excellent actress I haven't seen any movie she is in that I didn't enjoy..as with her ex-husband Bruce Willis
945,1,"Delightful romantic comedy with supernatural plotline: Demi Moore, a psychic with long blonde curls? Yes, but it works and she is charming and cute in this fun flick that is worth more than one viewing. Predictable? Sure. But who cares? It is a great way to spend a little leisure time.I also found it funny, especially Jeff Daniels as the shrink who doesn\'t know that he is already in love with the butcher\'s wife, long before they both find out they are each other\'s ""split aparts"". In the meantime, Demi\'s Marina character is busy match-making the neighbors, and then her own husband!"
946,1,"The buther's Wife, awesome: I really enjoyed this movie. It's a fun movie to watch. Demi Moore is really good in it. I love the plot and all the characters and how they all come together."
947,1,"This one can be seen over and over again!: If you like an off-beat movie full of irony,comedy,good music, and romantic twists(not to mention melodrama), then this is your movie. Never mind other movies with Demi Moore...this one is her best, and her best suited role ever. All the characters are kooky, even the ""shrink"". Just sit back and enjoy this over and over again!"
948,1,"Different piont of view: Borrego's book takes us into a different perspective about the Mexican-American relations since the Poinsett era to the Oil crisis in 1936, he explains also why there were no economical sanctions aginst Mexico after the goverment took it from the international investors, really recomended."
949,1,"THE ULTIMATE DEATH MACHINE PRODUCES...ICY DEATH: A crazed killer, known as the ""The Pig"" has gained control over the ultimate death machine, a bomb the kill\'s instantly with the coldest cold known to man and produces ICY DEATH. Secret of this bomb is implanted in the scalp of the inventor\'s daughter, thereby drawing her into the chase as countries bid for this weapon of destruction. Only one person (Jim Kelly) can protect the world from the fate of a madman in this gripping tale of murder, intrigue, kidnapping and torture Rated (R) Not for the kiddies...."
950,1,"jazzman: I remember when I had the 8-track(!) of this exquisite set of solopiano works from the genius Keith Jarrett. It always reminded me ofthe Koln Concert in a studio. The man is amazing! Manfred Eicher(ECM records owner/producer) knew what he had when Jarrett signedwith his label. I played this more times than I can remember backin the 70's when cars and home stereos had 8-track players. Of courseI have the cd now, which sounds better than ever. Just anotherbrilliant work of art from an artist with a staggering level of output.It sounds as fresh now as the day it was recorded. His Bremen Lausannesolo concerts on ECM are my favorite Jarrett solo recordings, but thisis brilliant all the same. Mandatory listening for Jarrett lovers."
951,1,"Great intellectual gymnastics: I completely disagree with his conception of reality, but I enjoyed this book. Bradley was a precursor to the language philosophers. Everyone seems intrigued with Wittgenstein; however, Bradley is far more comprehensive and profound. Plus, he writes very good English. Bradley distinguishes subtle naunces in meaning between words and in this way is a precursor to language philosophy. I also recommend C. S. Lewis's book, A Study in Words.I'm amazed that all the books I have on language philosophy exclude F H Bradley. He did everything language philosophers did before they did it."
952,1,"Great songs & musicians make this one a must-have!: I\'m a big Tom Snow fan and he wrote two of the best ones here ""Gettin\' Ready for Love"" and ""Top of the World"". I don\'t care for the ballads but that\'s minor as the other songs are mostly good. I love the funky ""Baby It\'s Me"" which Diana sings with Toto\'s Bobby Kimball. Similar to a funky song Olivia Newton-John recorded around the same time ""Totally Hot"". Most of Toto plays on this album along with Ray Parker, Jr. and David Foster. ""Your Love is So Good For Me"" is another fun, disco-ey song that someone should remake. I imagine this CD is hard to find, I\'m going to look at Tower and Virgin, as I have the old album and it\'s warped!!!"
953,1,Best songwriter since Lennon: I know Pete Wylie from the days of going the Banky our local pub he's a brilliant guy with a heart as big as Liverpool.Theres not one song that anyone can say is not good.Story of the blues was how we all lived in those days.come back was a never give up hope song that inspired many people in Liverpool to fight back.Every song has a meaning and in Pete Wylie we have a scouser with the lyrics of a John Lennon.Buy this album and you will feel the heartbeat of a true scouser.
954,1,Hair Street: ... The Lounge Lizards are masters of melody with riffs slightly reminiscent of other styles and periods but never a cheap copy of anything. I dont know how to express this exactly but attempting: all the musicians seem completely free to offer their own interpretations and not limited by what some big head thinks is cool or correct (ala Pat Metheny or Wynton Marsalis). Like Miles Davis' music was always so great because he just let his players play. I have heard so many mediocre bands with the best players- the Lounge Lizards are exactly NOT that!
955,1,"Not their best.: I\'m givin\' this CD 4 stars just \'cos Lurie is a mensch, but really, it\'s not their most interesting release BY FAR. The Lizards had graduated from being a punk/jazz joke into playing something like REAL JAZZ by the time of this release, but they were FAR from mature. Go for NO PAIN FOR CAKES or VOICE OF CHUNK or the Berlin release that DOESN\'T have ""Mr. Stinky\'s Blues"" on it, or buy QUEEN OF ALL EARS, if you haven\'t already. Even better -- hunt down the Marvin Pontiac disc. This one ain\'t really worth it."
956,1,"Required reading for Brooklyn history buffs: I am a born-in-Brooklyn lifelong New Yorker and local history buff. I found this book engrossing and highly informative in areas (agriculture, farming and land use) most local histories ignore.It is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand how the outer boroughs of New York developed.The photos are a hoot - showing long-urban areas as utterly unrecognizable farmland.The book's only shortcoming is the author's boilerplate Marxist analysis of how land and capital are used in a modern economy.With that one caveat, I heartily recommend this weighty tome for anyone seriously interested in New York outer-borough history."
957,1,Balaclave Junction Goes Dark: The Peter Shandy mysteries began strong (Rest You Merry) and then gradually became very light-hearted (The Curse of the Giant Hogweed). Exit The Milkman returns to an old and darker style of novel. Be sure and read the books in order.
958,1,"HOLMES GOES TO REHAB!: Adapted by Nicholas Meyer's from his clever 1974 novel, this is certainly among the most faithful iterations of Arthur Conan Doyle's famous fictional detective. The Herbert Ross directed film has Holme's loyal sidekick and chronicler Dr. John H. Watson (Alan Arkin) seeking the help of Dr. Sigmund Freud (Robert Duvall) in finding a cure for Holmes' debilitating cocaine addiction. Nicol Williamson portrays Holmes as an authentic addict, alternately hyper and depressed with manic episodes that suggest he has truly lost touch with reality. There's no tongue in cheek, winking at the audience here, but a solid piece of entertainment with the brilliant Holmes on the brink of losing his great mind to an obsession that leads to no solution but madness and death. The three lead actors are all excellent - Vanessa Redgrave has a supporting role -- and Williamson's drug addled Holmes is unforgettable. This fascinating film is long overdue for the a full Blu-ray restoration."
959,1,"Blu-ray edition of Seven-Per-Cent Solution: Fantastic film, and even more fantastic transfer to Blu-ray. Never saw the film before, nor the SD DVD edition; bought it on a whim after seeing the actors in it. Extraordinarily good acting, high production values, far above average BD transfer.NOW, if ""they"" would only release a comparably good BD of ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" (1970, MGM/UA) - it would be perfection for Baker Street Irregulars!"
960,1,"excellent movie: Story was changed just a little from the book, but it wasn't a big enough change to alter the feel. Excellent story and video. Well acted and very well cast."
961,1,A very Weird But Very Good Sherlock Holmes movie: I love Angst.So I love this movie.This movie couldn't be too far from the Truth...Sorta.ACD wrote that Holmes was an avid user of Cocaine and that in a few of the original Stories Watson tried to get him to leave it.The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that he got over his addition in one day.The movie also has some very weird withdrawal scenes. But I love the story. And have read the book.if you get a chance read the book before you see or after. The book came out not as a novel of the movie. But the movie was based on the book.It's a very good watch. if you like to see famous literary characters in torment.
962,1,"7% on demand: The reviews here can be confusing as they probably apply to other DVD versions of the film. This new on demand edition is in fact letterboxed and looks like the correct aspect ratio. Image quality may not be Criterion level but is very good, and given that this very enjoyable movie has been hard to get for years we are not complaining."
963,1,"Question on the music track . . .: Like many others, I consider this my favorite Sherlock Holmes movie of all time, and one of my all-around favorite movies, period. The casting is flawless, the production values sumptuous, and the video transfer is extremely good, even viewed on a high-definition screen (some regular DVDs look crumby on a high-definition TV). So I won't bother to repeat the lavish praise others have rightfully heaped on this film. My question is, does anyone know what, if anything, has been changed on the soundtrack? I never saw the film in a theater, and the original DVD release (unfortunately pan-and-scan) stated that portions of the music had been changed from the theatrical version, presumably for copyright reasons. This widescreen release seems to have identical music to that earlier DVD; does anyone know what specifically is different from the original theatrical release?"
964,1,Saving Sherlock: This oldie but goodie is a great film to add to your Holmes collection. It works well with the Holmes cannon (there are several references dropped for those familiar with Holmes) and the story is a lot of fun. The symptoms of cocaine withdrawal are not accurate (they more closely resemble alcohol withdrawal) but that's probably for dramatic effect. I'm glad this is back in print and at a reasonable price.
965,1,"The Cowboy: This is an excellent chronicle of the cowboy, his equipment, and his history.First published in 1924, and based on first hand experience as well as the oral testimony of the cowboys who lived the authentic life, it provides a researcher with details sufficient for an essay or a lesson plan."
966,1,Best condom for your $: Compared to every other condom this is the best. Their more expensive line of condoms really doesn't offer any advantage in my opinion other than packaging. This one wins hands down.
967,1,"""Made in Thialand"": I\'ve bought more of these blue-packaged Crown condoms from other suppliers since this particular purchase, and all of them have been fantastic. Every one has ""made in Thailand"" on the package even though I\'ve read reviews saying the ones made there (instead of Japan) were really bad. I\'ve never had the Japanese-made type, so maybe I\'m naive, but these are much thinner than anything I\'ve tried before, only lightly lubed (tip: supply your own, condom burns hurt) and have not broken once. They are tight (especially at the base) for an above-average dude, but not terribly uncomfortable. From a female perspective, it\'s very close to nothing at all. We tested out a few different condoms and these are our favorite, hands-down."
968,1,"Good quality and fast shipping: The product is good and fit to my size. However, if you are a big guy it will be a bit tight."
969,1,"Best condom: This is one of the best condoms I have used so far, super thin but strong. As some other reviewer said, this product soon becomes dry and need some lubricant."
970,1,"these puppies rock!: I recently bought 250 of the crown skinless skin condoms. These are the best condems I have ever used! they are super thin and it feels like I am not even wearing one. I have a 9"" cock and 5"" round and these fit perfectly. Also they were made in Thailand. I heard reports of some of them smelling. Well mine have virtually no smell at all.In fact, I am ordering 500 more today. So pleased. Thank you!!!"
971,1,loved these: these were my favorite condoms til i moved up to magnums.... these are great.. didnt have any latex allergies concerning the girls.. they were nice.. i really enjoyed it.. if your 10 inches long this aint for you.. if your 4 inches long this aint for you either.
972,1,Its good for the price: Its comfortable and easy to wear........For the price it is worth to get...I would recommend them to any ....
973,1,Best Ever: Crazy thin! I see why they are so highly recommended. Feels like nothing was there at all. I will recommend these to all of my friends
974,1,awesome: I read up on line about condoms. The crown was rated number one. It is by far the most natural feeling and sensitive condom I have ever used. Thumbs up all the way around.
975,1,"Still Have Plenty Left!: I saw these condoms posted as a deal on Slickdeals and decided to give it a shot. The reviews seemed mostly positive and the price was hard to beat. Unfortunately, I have only had the opportunity to use a few of these so far. Maybe if I get lucky enough I will have more experience with them and can update this review!!"
976,1,"Great Product: These condoms fit great and are very durable. The sensitivity is unparalleled compared to other brands I have tried. Currently, I have experience no breakages or any packaging defects."
977,1,Nice: Cant complain they are nice to wear. Very form fitting and not too much lube so they dont come of once your done.
978,1,Perfect: Came loosely packed in a yellow envelope bubble warpped. Got all 36.Expires in 3 years.Also recieved a ten percent off coupon.
979,1,"Fantastic!: Thinnest condom I have ever used, added about 30-40% more sensation that other ""thin"" condoms I\'ve tried. Never feared breakage at all. Could have used a little more width but nowhere near a deal breaker. Highly recommend."
980,1,Not bad but there's better: This is the 2nd choice out of what we've tried so far. My absolute favorite now is the Durex Ultra Sensitive. If that's what you're looking for its the way to go.
981,1,They're Good: My husband seems to like these. He said he can feel a difference between these and other brands.
982,1,"Great product quality, best ones out there!: These are the best by far that I have ever bought. You won't go wrong with these. High quality, never breaks and are very thin. Been buying these for years and will never go back."
983,1,"its a condom: pretty good condom, and is a very good price. if you dont like condoms you still wont like this one. it also has very little lubercation, so have some handy."
984,1,"All you need: I have tried tons of different brands and styles out, but these are by far the best I have used. It's nice to not have to look around anymore, I just buy these and I know I'll be happy with them."
985,1,"low price: With this low price, you can't ask more.Quality is good. Save money for other stuff like holiday gift etc."
986,1,"Comes in a bag: Other than that, not really a complain about it.Comes in a regular plastic/paper bag with the tape like thing on top to close it. So u better be the one to receive it, because easy to open and close with really noticing it someone did.Product was good. No complains"
987,1,Not the best but good enough.: These are not the best condoms I ever had but they do the job. Good enough for a fair price.
988,1,"Great Cheap Condoms: I was bit surprised when it came in USPS loose package. Though, I've been using it since then and greatly satisfied with this product."
989,1,"True to its name: I was using Kimono and Durex extra thins before they raised the prices for condoms at my college and after researching online at Amazon, came upon these. They are great! Really thin but well made and we have not had any problems with the fit."
990,1,"Very nice condom.: I enjoy these condoms. I have to rank it #2 though, reason for the 4 stars. There\'s a lot of good quality from this condom, being that its the most thin condom on the markety makes it great for pleasure. I mean, if there was stubs or ribs...it may be better for her pleasure, but as a personal pleasure it ranks at the top. ""LIKE nothing is there at all.However, this condom is a little too snug. Granted being a snug on me which I\'m no Mr ED, but with a girth 5""..it was a snug fit. With a snug fit comes advantages though such as, you know it\'ll never slip off. Also a tighter fit prolong the endurance.I still say Durex X-Sensitive is better. Just my opinion."
991,1,"Will Strongly Recommend: I've been using this brand for about four years with purchase from a couple of different sellers on Amazon. Among the brands I've used (Durex, TROJAN etc.), this is definitely the thinnest and best I've had. And my wife really enjoy them."
992,1,"Great Deal for an average condom.: These are thin enough to make you forget that you are wearing a condom, but they are a little tight. I am very happy with this purchase. Definitely worth the low low price."
993,1,100 Okamoto Crown condoms: I have to say I glad I bought this only its less embarrassing and the product arrived on time. I love using it. Thank for putting this product out.
994,1,"By Far the Best Condom Out There!: Like most men, I loathe condoms for their unique ability to kill the moment and suffocate junior to the point where... well, you know what I'm talking about! But this condom is amazingly sensitive, and you can barely tell that it's there. Goes on fast, and gives you a darn close to bareback feeling. Highly recommend this condom!!!"
995,1,"He's wily, that Pete Wylie: This album is a classic. Sing All The Saddest Songs, Disneyland Forever, I Still Love You, Hope You Fall (In Love), Hey! Mona Lisa and Heart As Big As Liverpool are stand-out tracks, each one packing gigantic emotional clout. Wylie's lyrics are of the simple, heartfelt kind. The music takes rock orchestration through a Phil Spector filter and is loaded with sharp, new wave attack and panache. Comparison with stalwarts of English rock music such as Bolan, Bowie and Ferry are apt and although Pete Wylie's songs don't cover the more avant-garde territory plied by those masters, he adds a drop of Motown and a touch of Bacharach for good measure. This album stands as fitting testament to Liverpool's most wayward genius."
996,1,"The Lady: Over 50 years I\'ve been digging Dinah ""The Lady"". She and Ella are THE Best!! However, I\'d have to select her CD ""What a difference a day makes!"" a bit over this one---everyone who digs great singers like The Lady should have a least these two cd\'s. Plus all of Ella\'s. Go out a spend a very bucks and relaxRC Napper"
997,1,"Dinah Washington's Hit Albums: Back in the 80s I owned the vinyl albums and the cassettes of Dinah's hits. Over time and many moves, I lost track of them. I am very happy to have them back in disk form!"
998,1,Maynard you are missed: Maynard one of the finest Band leader/trumpet player know to man.Few people are of the calliper to be a Legend as Maynard became.
999,1,"Worth it for the Price!!!: This is perfect if you plan on using this for lower back pain. I use this one for my lower back, and a gel type that is more flexible for my upper back.If I ever heal it will be perfect for bringing my lunches to work!"
1000,1,"Best Jumbo Cashews: The large cashews would get a 5, but there are filler chopped cashews that are not great."
1001,1,"The BEST: These Virginia Diner cashews are the best ever. So fresh and huge, no little pieces. Great for suprise company! The can is empty quick. Stock up for the Hoildays, makes a great hostess gift."
1002,1,"Wow!!: An all around amazing book! Get ready for some ""change in perspective"" as you step into Grandmothers shoes. Her story every bit, if not more, terrifying than that of her grandchildren. This book will break your heart with each turn of the page and beautifully sets the stage for Flowers in the attic. A must read for any Dollenganger fan!"
1003,1,Now It All Makes Sense: If you've read the Flowers in the Attic series you must read this it is the best one of them all!!! But don't read it before Flowers if you haven't read flowers yet. Read the series as it came out it makes this last one so much better.
1004,1,"at last the story of the hated grandmother's life: as much as we hated the grandmother in flowers in the attic, thisstory tells her early life and all the tragic events that ledup to the sadisic cold woman she would turn out to be. this bookis very good because it shows that we are a product of our environment and that most of us are not evil from the beginningbut circumstances sometimes make us turn out that way."
1005,1,"it makes sense!!!!!!!!!!: I read this right after FITA, but i didn't believe this was the same grandmother!!!!!!!!1 sorry but I did just love Olivia in the begining of this book. but it does explain a bit, and you then find out the whole truth that was never discovered!!"
1006,1,"sent this to my sister as well: i sent it to my sister so i couldn't tell ya, she seemed to be pleased though"
1007,1,"Make sure to read this one last.: Although this is a prequel to the Flowers in the Attic series, you should save this for last. This story wraps up some of the questions that you had in the earlier books. The book tells of the grandparents early years of marriage. I can not give away too much only to say that this book reveals the true reason that Corrine was disinherited and sets up the horrifying legacy that would follow them."
1008,1,"A must-read!: This is the last novel in the series, and I just loved it. I'm glad we finally got to meet the warped and enigmatic Malcolm Foxworth...AND see that the grandmother, Olivia, was at one time a human being. I also like Garland and Alicia. This book was haunting and unforgettable."
1009,1,"An excellent prequel, but doenst satisfy me: While I enjoyed the book, Olivia's plight against Malcom and society by no means justifies what she does to the Dollanganger children in FITA. While I do have a great deal of symapthy for her(losing her children,living without love etc) torturing innocent children because of what their parents did is inexcusable. Perhaps she was miss guided my her cousin John Amos, her only ally after the death of her sons. Perhaps if she had been more mature and not been so jealous of Corrinne 1/2 the bad things that occured in the book would have never happened-but then we wouldnt have a story now would we?"
1010,1,"Fantastic: I just hated the grandmother in all the other books, until this one. Then I just felt so sorry for her. Malcolm seemed like the type of man who should never get married. He is just not the type. She really wanted to marry for love, and look at what she received instead. She really did care for her children too. I really enjoyed it."
1011,1,"Heir to Heinlein: And I mean that review title for both good and ill. Like Heinlein\'s last few works (everything starting with _Number of the Beast_), the Callahan series has (d)evolved into tales of Extraordinarily Talented and Witty People, (over)laden with cultural in-jokes, references to earlier tales, and a twee jolliness that makes for light, breezy reading when it\'s not just irritating. Robinson has seemingly fallen into the ""How do I trump what I did last time?"" trap, and while it\'s nice to see the old gang again, hear the awful puns, and sit back for the ride, I look back on the much warmer, more *human* early Callahan tales (and even tales of Lady Sally\'s House) and miss them.I don\'t regret having bought the book, even at today\'s exorbitant paperback prices. I just wish I\'d enjoyed it as much as his earlier ones."
1012,1,"The gang's mostly back: And it turnd out that not only are they supposed to save the planet, but the whole darn universe as well. And tired of the whole Long Island rat race, they're moving to Key West. (circa 1989 before it got gentrified and duller). Fun stuff for the most part, and I liked the tale, but the pacing's a bit slower than the earlier Callahan books, which were pretty much short story compilations, and even the Lady Sally ones, which had at least a few seperate stories in each. It just seemed to take a long time for anything to happen, and Erin is just a bit too precocious."
1013,1,"Great reading!: I deeply enjoyed this book - i couldn't put it down! It's a short book, easy to read but very informative. It just made sense, it really resonated with me. I have felt a big pull towards the Sidhe over the past month and am just so pleased that this book was written. I just finished reading it today and i am very excited to begin the exercises given by the Sidhe. I recommend it for anyone wanting to know more about the Sidhe. )0("
1014,1,"Great new insight in the Sidhe: This book is a wonderful and easy read and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who's not only interested in the Sidhe, but also anyone who's open minded on world events today and what's happening to us as a planet and species. This book gives a wonderfully different perspective on the Fairy realm but also doesn't diminish the idea of the fantastical. My philosophy is that if you continue to hear a common thread is a variety of different sources, books, areas, etc. Then that common thread is truly worth paying attention to. This book is right along those lines but also gives new perspective and insight."
1015,1,"Fun - but full of bugs that the patch did not fix...: As a fan of the other ""tycoon"" games, I did enjoy playing this game. Although, as you figure out how the game works and what is necessary to succeed, it becomes less and less challenging. I run this on XP and even with the patch, the game still freezes or the people start to ""loop"" and can\'t move. Hopefully another patch will be released so I can continue to play the game."
1016,1,"Yes, it does work with Vista!: This is my kids' favorite game. I was worried it wouldn't work with Windows Vista, but it does! Life is good again at our house..."
1017,1,"An Oldie But a Goodie: So I was playing this game the other day, and it prompted me to write a review for those who might not have been fortunate enough to play it yet. Basically, the game is exactly what you'd expect... it's a sim/strategy type game where you take the role of a zoo keeper, and build your ideal zoo. With dozens of animals, from African hunting dogs to saltwater crocodiles to Asian black bears, this game should appeal to any wildlife enthusiast. The whole goal of the game is to make sure your animals, and guests, are happy. The former is achieved by placing them in a suitable environment, the later by building animal house (like 'reptile houses,' 'primate houses,' etc), resturants, gift stores and other attractions. You can choose several scenarios, from free form games to pre-made games that require you to achieve certain, increasingly challenging, goals. Over all, a very cool game, and one you can get cheaply too. But it will still provide hours of enjoyment. Go for it!"
1018,1,"Good game, but not perfect: I thought that this game was actully pretty good, and it is addicting and fun. however, i have one complaint. the AI of the guests is TERRIBLE! when they are reallly really hungry, thirsty,tired,have to go to the b-room, etc, they walk RIGHT BY the things that would make it all better. this needs to be fixed in a patch or something."
1019,1,"Good Stuff...: Nice package for your kids. Although it can be complicated, it's worth the money. Though you may have to sit at the computer and work with your youngster to help him/her understand the full potential of the product."
1020,1,"Very Cool: This game is a lot of fun, but I recommend getting the Zoo Tycoon Complete. You get more options with it."
1021,1,"Run a Zoo, Have a Little Fun: In Zoo Tycoon you get to run your own zoo. (I'm sure you could have guessed that.) You set up animal exhibits, roadpaths in your zoo, and tourist facilities. When you set up the animal exhibits, the creatures you put in those cages are REALLY picky. Some want this, while others want that and it is difficult to please all the animals in a single exhibit. (They usually agree better if they're the same species of animal.) This game is fun for the first few hours, but soon gets boring. I suggest playing a demo of this game before purchase."
1022,1,"Zoo Tycoon Good, but not Great: Zoo Tycoon is a great game for strategy, but lacks a certain something. Sometimes the updates don't work and it isn't very realistic."
1023,1,"Really Fun: This game is sooooo fun! I played it with my friend, and we played it for a relly long time. I reccomend it if u like animals, or if you have other ""tycoon"" games."
1024,1,"Zoo Tycoon: Okay, it's not Rollercoaster Tycoon, but what is? An intriguing premise, easy to play, but hard to master, due in no small part to some poor programming of the actions of the zookeepers (who are responsible for the feeding of, cleaning up behind, and tending to the health of, your animals) and the maintenance workers (who are *supposed* to empty trashcans, mend fences, etc.). Your zookeepers, for the most part, tell you what your animals need, although they aren't as reliable as a zoo-owner would hope. And your maintenance workers don't always seem to notice the completely collapsed fences that will allow your elephants to trample your guests...But the variety of animals, complete with their necessary terrains, vegetation, and shelters, makes this game fun, it a bit frustrating, to play. Recommended, with caveats."
1025,1,"Zoo tycoon: I borrowed this game off a friend, and almost refused to give it back! This game was instead of homework for me! I just couldn't stop playing. I found the layout and access to different controls extremely easy, making this fabulous gameplay. The graphics were quite good. I enjoyed feeding the animals and finding out if they had young! You always had to check on them to see if they had food and had suitable exhibits, which was good because it introduced a slight feeling of desperateness. When youre animals were happy or when an endangered animal was born you would earn awards. You have scientists who research different animals, toys, shelters and park equipment such as merry go rounds and stuff. If you made a good enough park with interesting exhibits and side shows, you're park would become a Zoo Tycoon!!!!Try and be a zoo tycoon yourself by buying this game!"
1026,1,"zoo tycoon a must buy!: ...it is totally adictive.u start off by the practice game 2 get u started and then u can play freeform! with soo much 2 do (caring 4 your animals, building exhibits, restraunts, reptile houses, water fountains,gift shops, elephant rides) u wil always be playing on it no matter what!the music is really cool and if you get bored of building your own zoo try the sceniros.(u have 2 do the tasks they want in a limited time only.)oh and becarful cos if your animals r not happy lots of terrible things happen so beware!!!!!!!!!"
1027,1,"Rollercoaster Tycoon fans will love this.: Microsoft finally did something right! Zoo Tycoon is quite a good game. It's a lot like Rollercoaster Tycoon. There are various scenarios where you must build a zoo and ensure that you've a certain number of exhibts, get a certain number of guests, etc. There's also a freeform mode that's quite fun. I bought this as a bundle with Monopoly Tycoon, and this is most certainly the better of the two.The one thing that I didn't like is that the interface is a bit slow at times, and it can be a bit confusing. Overall, for the fans of Rollercoaster tycoon, and like games (Sim City, etc.), would like this game."
1028,1,"gameee: It is a fun game overall. But after a while, all your animals go sad. And non of its workers do anything, no matter how many u have. The people would walk off the side walks and would walk where ever. It scarred me when i first seen this, cuz all of them were in a line walking in a box formation, so i took tigers and let them eat em. But anyways, its a nice game for minimum fun. i am gald I got it though, hope you have funn!!"
1029,1,"I am going to buy this game: I downloaded the demo of Zoo Tycoon off of Microsoft.com It is a good demo, with enough detail and teasers to have made me play late into the night. I will be buying this game very shortly.I love games like The Sims, Age of Empire, Caesar III and Black & White, etc. From what I can tell from the demo, this game is very detailed oriented, like the beforementioned games. Plus, it has the freedoms that micro-managing-builder gamers, like myself, live for! It does feel like it is a bit more geared for children but that doesn't take away from the fun. If you like the games mentioned about, I have no doubt you will get hours of enjoyment with Zoo Tycoon."
1030,1,"Pretty good: I *loved* Roller Coaster Tycoon, so when I saw Zoo Tycoon and read that they played similar, I couldn\'t wait to pick it up.I don\'t like it as much as I liked RCT though...it\'s RCT minus the fun of building the roller coasters, which I really enjoyed.I do like building the zoo, however. The animals are neat, the sounds and graphics are pretty good, and the interface was easy for me to use. I do miss some of the RCT features though, like controlling the prices of your food kiosks globally. The patrons of your zoo are much more varied and interesting than the ""peeps"" of RCT.Overall, a good fun game, but not quite as addicting as RCT was. I\'m already getting a bit bored with it, and have had it only a month."
1031,1,"#1 Creating Game: I think Zoo Tycoon is the best building game I have ever played. You can have so many different animals, and even make beaches by combining water and sand. One of the only problems is that the animals reproduce way too fast. I started with 4 lions and ended up with 26! Luckily, you are able too sell your animals. I HIGHLY recommend this game. It is really fun."
1032,1,"An absolute joy! :): Unlike some tycoon games which are a bit too tedious and require a lot of time and patience, Zoo Tycoon is so easy to get into and very entertaining and enjoyable fun for all ages.It has it's flaws (don't most games?!) but at the end of the day, I haven't played a game this enjoyable for a long time.Build your zoo, look after it, keep the animals happy and get funding to buy the more rarer animals...The animals look and sound great even though they are very small graphics (A sequel could improve on this and allow to take a closer look at them, and maybe an even more bigger variety of animals)...At the end of the day, Zoo Tycoon is one of those games which make you wonder why they don't make more of this sort of thing...Highly recommended! :)"
1033,1,"Awesome!: This game is fun but the reason why i put 4 stars,is because sometimes the guests can be mad and leave the area.But still it's fun!!!! Enjoy Amazon.com!"
1034,1,the news of the zoo: Really good. When you first start it can be hard learning how to use all of the buttons and controls but after you play for a while it is really good. You can go mad on freedom games. You can pick how much money you start with. The puzzles and hard but fun. I really liked this games and everybody out there probabley finds it fun too.
1035,1,"**Very entertaining... hard to please**: I love this game - not only can you design the animal's habitat, but you can choose how many animals and create all types of attractments in your zoo. The only negativity I found in the game was how hard it was to please both your customers and the animals at the same time. It's very challenging and fun. AND you can download animals from the website, so I think it was worth the money - well, maybe 1/2 the price."
1036,1,"Pretty good!: I am really into tycoon games, and of the ones I own this one is definitely a cool one. I like the fact that you can put up fences and build your own custom environments for each animal. Although sometimes it does get hard to handle with keeping the grass from being trampled, that is part of the challenge! Another thing that I wish was added to this game was that you can get a Zookeeper to stay in just one exhibit. Unfortunately they walk around and sometimes the pens get ""poo"" in them, and the animals lack food. Those are the only two things that I have to complain about. Something good is you can start in a land with up to $500,000!!!! I like that a lot... I would recommend this game to people that like tycoon games and like to keep track of things for sure!"
1037,1,"chicago mom: My son, who is 5, is addicted to this game. It is amazingly creative, and although you would think you need to read fluently, there are enough symbols that my 5 year old navigates through all on his own.He found out that instead of assigning a zookeeper to feed the alligators, he could just put zebras in their exhibit and they would make a delicious dinner!He also loves animals so much, that he took down their fences to set them free, and the game is so adaptable, that the animals actually started chasing the guests and eating them! This initially was little greusome, and now he is very protective of his guests, but the creativity is wonderful.A must for animal lovers. Great for kids to use their imagination and much better than vegging out in front of the TV."
1038,1,"Good, But Roller Coaster Tycoon is Better: This Game allows you to create your own zoo, with lots and lots of different kind of animals, exibits, shops, and more! The Scenarios are allright, and the animals look really realistic! I would reccomend getting the double expansion pack also, so you can have water animals and dinosaurs in your zoo too. You can also download different animals and scenery on the original one, and put them in your zoo. It is pretty obvious Zoo Tycoon is competing with Roller COaster Tycoon. So if you buy this, get the double expansion pack with it or later, and the game will be well worth the money."
1039,1,"Fantastic. :): I do child care, and this cd is one of our favorites. I play it every day during naptime on low, and it lets the children know that now it is rest time. The music is so soothing and I couldn't imagine not having it. :)There have been a few times I forget to turn it on, and the kids quickly remind me..."
1040,1,"Great plot involving the supernatural: Sarah keeps seeing her cat Shadow. Her dead cat Shadow. Things are happening too fast for Sarah. Her older brother is home from college, her mother hires a new housekeeper, and Shadow keeps appearing in dreams. Her brothers fight often and their parents ignore them. Nobody believes that Shadow is there. Then it happens, the reason why Shadow had stayed instead of processeding on to the cat afterlife.Shadow is a nice, spenceful book that mixes in a bit of supernatural into the usual (if extreme) problems of life. The characters are well delevoped and rounded off nicely."
1041,1,"Cat lovers and supernatural lovers will enjoy this book!: This book was sooo exciting. I couldn't put it down. It almost made me believe it was real . . . that a cat could actually come back from the grave! The characters were really interesting and realistic, especially Sarah's brothers. Anyone who likes the supernatural (and who doesn't) wil love this book."
1042,1,Review of GeoTrax Harbor Docks L ighthouse: My youngest sons face light up every time this lighthouse is triggered by a passing train. Fantastic product. Always pleased with the GeoTrax series.
1043,1,"Covers a lot of topics, clearly written: This was the assigned book for the class and I found it for a great price on Amazon. Covered a lot of topics and was clearly written with well explained examples."
1044,1,Looking for solutions manula for this edition: I was wondering if anyone knew where I could find the solutions manual or selected answers for this book.if you do would you please contact me atRobert.mcnulty@colorado.eduThanks
1045,1,"warm, soft throw, but cover is synthetic: This is a great, warm, cuddly throw blanket, but if (like me) you read the description and think the cover is 100% cotton, think again -- the tag on the product says it is 100% polyester. Hopefully Amazon will fix this typo soon. However, while it does have a slight polyester sheen and rustle, the fabric is really very pleasantly soft with a suede-like finish. And unlike the other reviewer, who claimed that the clover green throw was more ""pea-soup"" or ""puke"" green, I\'m happy to say mine turned out to be a beautiful light silver-sage. All in all, I\'m pretty happy with this product. It\'s feather-light, toasty-warm, machine-washable, and big enough to cover a 5\'3"" person like myself from feet to shoulders while lying on a couch."
1046,1,"Great Blanket for One.: This blanket is soft, fluffy, warm, and easy to wash. Mine is blue and the color is very nice. I really have no complaints about this product, I just occasionally wish it were bigger! It gets a little crouded if two people try to share."
1047,1,"Titanium is a good thing: Well, I have to say I was so excited to see my new hammer show up. I looked forward to using it the very next day. It is such a great change to go from a 22 ounce framer to one that is so much lighter and well balanced. I have used many different hammers and this one ranks right close to the top. The only downfall I noticed was that concrete cut nails take the face down quite fast, even though I did't drive many. Overall it is a great hammer to have in your hand all day."
1048,1,Titanium Death Stick hammer: I purchased this hammer for my son who is a carpenter by trade.He said it is the best hammer he has ever owned.He loves the light weight and the curved handle.Every one that has tried out his hammer says they would love to have one like it.He also says he would never want to go back to a steel headed hammer agin.Also says the next hammer he buys will be a Death Stick.
1049,1,Bad Dog: Enjoyed the quick read book however it was not what I was expecting. It was more like a kid's book or a waiting room book. It was cute.
1050,1,"Yes it's staged but it's HILARIOUS: I laugh so hard I cry at most of these photos and captions. This kind of stuff is my guilty pleasure. Even when this book is in the bathroom, a casual flip through makes me laugh. If you like dogs and their wacky antics, get this book."
1051,1,really cute: I bought this book because I own Bad Cat. I think this book is witty and funny but not quite as good as the cat one. Most of the pictures did make me crack up laughing but I laughed harder and at more pictures in the cat book. I would still recommend it to anyone as it is really funny but they should definitely buy Bad Cat as well.
1052,1,"humorous book: I choose this book because its cover stood out amongst the other books. In this book there are quotes next pictures. The pictures have dressed up dogs in them. There\'s really no plot. It\'s all pictures with funny quotes around them. There is not much to write about this book because there\'s no plot.This book might not seem interesting to some of you, but those with a sense of humor will love it! One picture has two dogs looking over the back of a sofa, and the quote says,"" is that your vomit or mine?"" its funny because they have the weirdest pictures with hilarious quotes.My opinion on this book is.........BUY IT!!!!!!! it is so funny. I don\'t however recommend this book to anyone under thirteen. Due to the situations of some quotes and some of the language"
1053,1,"Awesome work out!: This is the second Gunnar Peterson DVD I've purchased. I love his instruction, and his exercises. They really work! He keeps up a good pace, gives very helpful guidance, and is definitely a top flight trainer. IF you're serious about working out and either getting in or staying in shape, his DVD's are a great addition to your program."
1054,1,"great quick workout: I love this DVD. I had it a couple of years ago, and lost 50 pounds. It got stuck in my DVD player, and I went without for a long time. I bought it again, and it is my favorite workout. I just love it. I am 210 pounds, so I cant do a really long workout yet, but I started back at 227, so I have lost some weight. your whole body will be sore! Even when I got down to 190 last time I had it, I just bought wrist and ankle weights to increase the intensity. Its fun, its a good workout, and its not too long. Its also really cheap!"
1055,1,"Very happy: I ordered this DVD not knowing for sure if this would work for me. I have to say I am very happy and for you folks that enjoy working out at home, I would really recommend this DVD for you!"
1056,1,"Excellent short biography: This was a beautifully written biography of the Holy Father and his life from birth to the present. The author includes information that I had not previously heard, addresses topics currently debated by many, including Fatima. It was a book difficult to put down, a quick read, one that I didn't want to end."
1057,1,"Indie Rock that holds up over time: I heard the song ""dreamworks"" while listening to a local college radio station. I purchased the cd and on first listen was overall happy with it. A few songs immediately stood out and the others flowed nicely. Over the next few weeks and after repeated listens, this cd keeps getting better and better. There are a lot of subtle details mixed in with excellent songwriting and an honest delivery. I certainly can hear the Neutral Milk Hotel influence and I like the meandering horns that come and go (in the background and foreground) in a style that reminds me of Okkervil River. This is an excellent indie-rock cd that I believe will hold up over time."
1058,1,"Not Jeff Mangum... but close.: I ordered this cd along with about 10 others. This is the one that stuck out, and got locked on repeat. From Waves rolling until the end. A lot of people try and talk about bands that are carrying on where Jeff Mangum left off, but I will say that I think this is one of the few that I can honestly say even come close to his genius. I would recomend it to anyone who is a fan of NMH."
1059,1,"Review of The Phoenix Effect: With years of experience, Pate and Platt help the senior manager navigate the rough waters of restructuring, renegotiations and mergers. With case studies from some of the most recognizable names in industry, your company cannot afford to do without these vital strategies on corporate renewal and revitalization."
1060,1,"Well written and to the point: Harlan Platt and Carter Pate have created an excellent work balancing the ""real world"" of corporate renewal and ""academic analysis"". Most works on the subject are either rehashed war stories providing little insight into the subject or long and dry academic works missing the nuances and human elements of fixing companies.The nine strategies focus on the issues that most turnaround consultants deal with one way or another during their work. While professionals may mentally go through these exercises and use these strategies, this is a solid summary for everyone else to learn from and follow.As a turnaround consultant, I have read almost all the books on the subject and found this one to be closer to the truth than any other."
1061,1,"Must Read: Having taught in a business school for several years and having read enough business ""best sellers"" in my time to form a limited expectation, I was more than pleasantly surprised when I read The Phoenix Effect. This book is different. Every page contains something business people need to know. It is easily read yet filled with great insight and wisdom. I will be asking students to read The Phoenix Effect in the future. You should definitely read it too.Henry M. Garelick"
1062,1,"A superb guide for any traveler seeking to visit and pay his respects to these hallowed burial grounds: Now in its third newly revised edition, Arlington National Cemetery is a thorough guide to America's shrine upholding the highest respect in memory of the astronauts, actors, writers, and Supreme Court justices among its 300,000 honored dead.

Appendices and an index round out this superb guide for any traveler seeking to visit and pay his respects to these hallowed burial grounds."
1063,1,"A terrific tale spun from fact and fiction: This re-release of the first Brady Coyne novel is certainly welcome. From the get-go, Tapply spins a thrilling yarn that's the very best kind of fact-based fiction. Even if he doesn't want to be one, Brady makes a heck of fine detective. A keeper, for sure. Check out the new intro that Tapply wrote specifically for this editon."
1064,1,"The first blockbuster application for OS X version 10.1!: I\'m basing this review on the word X test Driver version, available on the Microsoft matopia site. From what I\'ve seen so far, this is one very good app--everything has been made to work with the Aqua interface, the layout is quite easy to learn and use quickly, and I find myself using it more and more everyday. Of course, in the Test Drive doesn\'t have all of the features included--you can use the project gallery for the basics, but you\'ll have to wait for printing to be enabled, for example. The best part--when I redid my resume and send it as an attachment, I don\'t hear the old ""resend it as a Word doc!"" complaint anymore. I\'ll upgrade to Word X for sure!"
1065,1,"First World, HA! The Zapatista Challenge: This was definitely a wonderful book, with a five star rating. After I was first introduced to this subject, I was overwhelmed by the subject, and this was the first book that I had. I scraped up some 13 dollars or so, and rushed to the book store with nothing but the 13 dollars, and an inch of backround on Mexican history. After I had rushed home, within a day I was finished with the book. I had enough knowledge, that I performed a speach at my school, since then I have been active in protesting US military aid to Mexico. I have been writing letters to congress, calling the local mayors office, organizing protests, and group meetings to discuss."
1066,1,These jelly fish rock!!!: I enjoy the jellyfish. It is quite bright at night. The product is designed to be used after dark. Very unique pool toy.
1067,1,"Mulitples every time!: It took me awhile to ""play"" with this to figure out the best way...Thankfully, it is a very ""flexible"" product, so a movement of the hand transforms its position easily to adjust for individual ""needs""...I have always had a great sex life and wonderful orgasms...However, I now have multiple orgasms of such intensity, it is unimaginable! Seriously, every time I use this thing, I cum 10-20 times! I go 30-60 minutes! Then, the ultimate climax occurs and it is explosive! I never thought this level of pleasure was possible. I now use this on a daily basis and have incorporated it into my ""partner"" play with my husband, as well. He LOVES it!"
1068,1,"Watch it Walk!!!: OMG!! This was my first vibrator....years ago....turn it on...put it on the bed, floor, counter....watch it walk, roll etc... ALL BY ITSELF!!!! Years of pleasure!!!!!"
1069,1,"Practical and easy to digest information: This is a great book if you're looking for ways to bring a group of people together and establish positive group dynamics. Whether you've had lots of experience in facilitating group sessions, or none, you'll find the ideas useful. The opening section highlights the pivotal role a facilitator has in ensuring groupwork is affective. The emphasis in the mode of presentation is to give participants the sense that what they contribute is worthwhile and that they can achieve - as a group and as individuals. There are sure to be activities to suit any group size, interest, ability and comfort level. The activities themselves are written in such a way as to encourage you to adapt them if they aren't exactly meeting your groups needs. Adapation and exploration of ideas is encouraged, with an emphasis on fun, participation and acceptance."
1070,1,Another Rohnke Winner!: This is another Karl Rohnke winner. If you work with experiential learning (either with kids or adults) this is a great book to have in your library. This book contains a lot of old activities as well as some new ones. As with a lot of experiential activities -- it's great to have the procedure written out. This book is well worth the price.
1071,1,"It Just keeps getting better: I was just starting out leading a team building group and I found this book to be an incredible help. With some creativity, almost all of the activities can be adapted for adolescents and done in-doors. The section on leadership was good but a little simplistic. Regardless I consult this book almost every week and do not know what I'd do with out it!!! I highly reccomend it!"
1072,1,"A real must!: This is one of the most useful books in the Adventure Education field - both as a resource for those new to the field, and as a constant reference for those more experienced. I have used many of the games and dynamics for youth of all ages."
1073,1,"Mayo Clinic Family Health Book: What an amazing source of information!! It is a definate must have for new parents. This detailed, yet easy to understand book offers specific chapters by age including newborns. It give prevenative information on health & safety including tooth care, controlling stress and travelng abroad. Of course first aid and diseases and disorders are the bulk of the book. It is well written easy to use and include helpful illustrations and photos. Every household should have one, but certainly families with children, of any age should have this book to refer to."
1074,1,"Great book!!!: My son is issued this book from the school. So as to not have him bring books home, I buy duplicate books for him to use at home."
1075,1,"Great Earrings!: These are great earrings! I was looking for black dangle earrings, and the onyx & beads give them style. They can be worn with casual or dress. They are solid and substantial, but not too heavy."
1076,1,"This cd rules: This cd is amazing and for sure the best one man band's ever! Just an amazing cd that sounds great. It's brutal, heavy and catchy amazing cd."
1077,1,"Amharic usefulness depends on where you are: Actually I didn't use the book very much, as my surroundings were almost all English or Oromo-speaking. Before spending much time on a learning a language to use in Ethiopia, be sure to check out the location. Since the Amhara's are no longer the dominant tribe, their language may be less useful. Tigrayans are now in power and Oromo are the largest language group."
1078,1,"Blues instrumentals: If you love blues instrumentals ala Freddie King, you'll enjoy this compilation. Driving gutsy guitar and a good variety of bluesy vehicles."
1079,1,"Pleasantly surprised: I picked this one up on a whim, aware of Thackery's history with the Nighthawks. If you like to hear real fretboard mastery, give this one a shot. While he has a sound truly his own, you'll definately hear some of his influences: Buddy Guy and SRV were obvious idols of his. This purely instrumental CD covers nearly all aspects of of the 12-bar march, too. Jazz, chicken picking, a bit of country, jump, swing--an ...-kicking extravaganza. Get it, you won't be disappointed. As a fellow guitar slinger, I've been humbled!!"
1080,1,"KICKIN\' THE BLUES: This is a top-notch CD, packed full of Thackery\'s amazing guitar work. I have been a long-time fan of Jimmy Thackery, I own all his solos CDs and over a dozen NightHawks. To finally come out with a instrumental CD is great !! I have all the songs, except the three new ones, but it is still great to have in one package. The last three songs, which take place live at Sulleys, and last over twenty minutes, is the best part of the CD. I was fortunate to be at the small club when it was recorded, and these excellent grooves of ""Rude Mood"" and ""Detroit Boogie"", along with the already released, ""Edward\'s Blues"" make in plainly obvious that there is nobody better than Jimmy Thackery and the Drivers when it comes to kickin\' out some tasty rockin\' blues grooves. This is really a great disc, I highly recommend it, even if you do have all his others."
1081,1,Replacement Battery for Gateway Solo 9300: The order was processed quickly. I received the item promptly and it was quickly installed and charged up and is working great. It was a great buy and a great transaction.
1082,1,"Beautiful Doll: This lovely doll was purchased formy neice. I think it is over rated just because it\'s an ""American Girl"" doll. Although it is very pricey, the doll is beautifully made and her clothes are sweet, too!"
1083,1,"Endearing and Humorous!: Mark Dunn\'s new book is the perfect antidote to winter chill. Curl up with it in front of a fireplace while a blizzard rages outside, and watch it warm your heart and cheer your soul. Set in a small town in the Bible Belt south, the book traces the lives of several characters, including a despondent minister, a sagacious masseuse, the local male heartthrob and several cultists, over a Labor Day weekend. Stereotypes quickly fade in the author\'s able hands, as he weaves a tale of his characters\' endearing foibles and takes the plot round some unexpected twists and turns. There are some absolutely hilarious passages, written with a deadpan humor that had me laughing out loud in the middle of the night. The book is in many ways richer than the author\'s award-winning ""Ella Minnow Pea"", and demonstrates Dunn\'s extraordinary versatility as a writer - the subtext is more subtle, the humor more biting, the author\'s command of setting and tone more skilled. Well done!"
1084,1,"Great Square: This is a wonderful little square. I work with 3/4x3/4 inch, to 1x1 inch pieces of wood and acrylic and this fits great in my shop apron. I certainly recommend."
1085,1,"Oldie but goodie: We've owned several of this type of Makita 9.6v cordless for as long as 20 years and aside from a few minor glitches from time to time they're all still running fine. The NiMi batteries are an improvement over the old NiCad. Since we own several of them we've stayed with the 9.6v so we never run out of batteries as well as the fact that their performance is more than adequate for most of our needs. Considering that you can buy this whole package for nearly the price of a pair of batteries, it makes it a no brainer. I needed more batteries so I just bought another package. If you're a first time buyer of Makitas, you might want to go for the other models that allow the convenience of standing the drills upright, are slightly more compact and have a more power if you need it."
1086,1,"Disposable drills: Pros: Lightweight, price, and powerful enough for a majority of home weekend projectsCons: Battery life span is bad. This would not be an issue, but makita battery packs are expensive. The price of replacement batteries is similar to the price I paid for the drill/flashlight/charger/2battery set. Battery pack is sealed so its not possible to access and replace the battery cells. battery cells are very cheap.Both my batteries are dead. I got good use out of the drill but I'll have to buy another drill set.... Drills are becoming disposable items now!"
1087,1,Best mid size cordless drill: I really do like the 9.6 midsize cordless drill. I also have & have owned the smaller model makita drill of 7.2 vold cordless. I like the weight of both drills & I hope the never stop making them. 9.6 volt Makita 6095DWBLEX
1088,1,"Raw honesty, very healing: This riveting, poetic account of childhood suffering reaches deep into early trauma and abuse. Reading this gripping account will help you access your own childhood memories and heal from abuse. Thank you for the courage to write this book!"
1089,1,"A disturbing yet fascinating read: ""screams from childhood"" kept me turning the pages! Barbara Rogers\' voyage into her sad, dark past and her recognition of painful family flaws is being told in beautiful poetic words and phrases. Because of her brave honesty I learned about her strength and determination to set herself free. Congratulations, Barbara!"
1090,1,An intriguing look at ancient civilizations: A beautiful book with excellent photography. It summarizes the world's ancient civilizations and gives the armchair traveler a look at how our world developed. Very fascinating accounts.
1091,1,"Basically the Same, with a New Surprise: What sold me on this upgrade was the other reviewers' testimonies about the complaints they would receive from PC owners about not being able to open Word documents created on a Mac. I began experiencing that problem, thinking it was a system issue rather than a bug in the 2001 software.Anyway, I bought this upgrade because I didn't need the whole Office Suite, which is three times more expensive. I haven't had the chance to explore all of Word's new features, but so far I'm happy with it. The upgrade from Office 2001 was painless. The user interface is basically the same as the 2001 version, so there were no big learning curves.Much to my surprise, I found out that I could save my document as a PDF file right from Word with one click of a button. I didn't have to go into Acrobat Acrobat or Distiller in order to accomplish this.Recommended."
1092,1,"The best of the best.: I am teaching in college since 25 years. We always used Macintosh.At home, I have a iMac. I used Office 2001,which is a very good product. Then I had to install APPLE X, then Ibought Microsoft Office X (including Word X) for teacher. I am filled. Ittook only 30 minutes to install it. Immediately I felt comfortable.There are many improvements. And the items that I used more werepreserved, and improved. Word is very pretty, powerful, more powerful,more quickly. All my documents of Office 2001 opened such as theywere. I did not lose any data. And the connection with the Web is the best to. I recommend it to my colleagues at work.Thank you Microsoft."
1093,1,"Excellent performance of 1968 band: This is a particularly inspired outting for the 1968 band. This recording probably comes from their July 1968 European tour, but the CD doesn't give a specific date (and the CD does not correspond with any of the performances documented in Sheridan's COUNT BASIE: A BIO-DISCOGRAPHY). Compared with the Juan-les-Pins performance of July 23, the repertoire is similar but the performances here are better -- the rhythm section in particular is very spontaneous -- and the recording quality is above average (and stereo).Many tracks are misidentified: (2) is Blues for Ilean, (5) is Boone's Blues, (6) is Whirly-Bird, and (10) is a blues in C for the rhythm section -- 4 minutes of Basie's sparkling piano, in a playful mood.The sound quality isn't perfect (some distortion and shifting of stereo image), and there are many concert recordings -- but this is one of the best of the late 1960s."
1094,1,"Billy does a great job but Tracey Yorks is awful!: This tape is exactly what I needed in regards to Billy Blanks\' workout. Not being a morning person I can\'t do Tae Bo in the morning but I sure can work out with weights and do Master Blaster in the morning. And I can feel results. This is a great companion to the Tae Bo Series. Billy does a great job, even better than the Kickology video. And with his workout you can always increase weight size and thus increase the workout intensity so you won\'t ""out-grow"" the workout too soon. Tracey Yorks is terrible. Her workout is why I never did at home video workouts until I was introduced to Billy Blanks. While his moves are easy to follow, deliberate, and smooth, hers are impossible to follow and downright silly.The tape is worth the price of admission for Billy Blanks\' workout. Think of it that way and don\'t waste your time with Ms. York."
1095,1,"Great playlist...what could you expect?: Early days...Pete Fineston on drums kit, Greg Hetson with long hair, a bit more hair on Greg Graffin's head and now-millionnaire Gurewitz dressed in Converge...THAT'S AWESOME! Now, about the music. Hard to believe Suffer was for once called 'the brand new album' from Bad Religion. Lots of songs are from that cd, plus earlier work like Frogger, Drastic Actions... Really great compilation. Graffin shows on earlier songs how unique and incredible lyricist he is. He should have been president, but eh...you can't always get what you want! And for those who are complaining about the sound, I think it adds some charm to the whole thing, plus, it's only punk rock right?"
1096,1,"Superb performance, poor picture quality: The bad part of this production is not the performance itself but the quality of the reproduction, sooo sad. Lucky enough, I have a 'Sharp' TY. It permits me to enhance the picture quality so that I could see the stage and the backgrounds.The good part is the performance of all actors vocally etc. If you an opera buff, like I am, this is a must, despite."
1097,1,Good and tasty!: The item was received before Xmas as planned. :-) I was impressed by that alone. They tasted awesome. I would purchase again!
1098,1,excellent: This is the 2nd order for me. I give one can as a gift and keep the other for me. Great chocolate and good almonds. I think this is supposed to be good for you.
1099,1,Remembering Their Roots: Shaw/Blades did an excellent job of staying true to the spirit of these covers while still managing to put a new spin on them and make them feel contempory. It's obvious they have not forgotten where they came from or every one that came before them. A great album of classic songs which will never go out of style. I hope at some point they decide to do another one of these. Strong vocals with beautiful harmonies. A fun CD to listen and sing along with.
1100,1,"Wonderful Reminiscing!: This was a gread CD. I recommend this for anyone who grew up in the 60\'s and 70\'s who loved that music. It was great to hear this wonderful ""old"" stuff again. These two artists gave a feel as if the songs were almost live and redid them close to the originals but put just enough difference in each song to make it sound new and refreshing. I have listened to the CD over and over - \'feel like I am back in high school.This is a definate buy for all of you baby boomers! The artists get 5 stars from me and should do more of these types of CD\'s!Bob PickChicago, Illinois"
1101,1,"To push up the average again.....: This is a great covers album, with Tommy and Jack wonderfully singing wonderully picked songs."
1102,1,"2 thumbs up (& not there): This CD kicks butt. Lately I\'ve been getting into rock bands doing covers i.e. Rick Springfield ""Day After Yesterday"", Styx ""Big Bang Theory"", etc.This does justice to the bands covered and is a definite good addition to your CD collection. Tommy Shaw & Jack Blades prove they have the chops to do these tunes justice."
1103,1,"Some interesting readings of some of classic rocks classics.: I discovered this gem while reading Sterling Whitakers wonderful book about Styx, ""The Grand Delusion"". I didn\'t know it existed, but after reading about it I wanted to hear what it was that inspired Tommy to pick up the guitar. Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw do a great job covering some of rocks most influential songs. Some tracks are true to their origins and some display and rather unique reading of the songs. There isn\'t a loser in the bunch though.All in all this is a great album, well worth seeking out. If you are a fan of Styx/Tommy Shaw or NightRanger/Jack Blades, you\'ll find this album a great addition to your collection."
1104,1,"New Take On Old Songs: Shaw-Blades ""Influences"" is a good compliment to the original artists. My personal favorite on the album is Simon & Grafunkle\'s ""I am a rock"" I bought this CD after hearing them on The Howard Stern Show."
1105,1,old music new sound: this album is nice. the songs are not original but the sound is modern... according to shaw and blades. just a little taste of styx (if you like them).
1106,1,"Shaw Blades Influence Review: Great album - good song choices. Tommy Shaw still can sing the high notes like when he was 20. I saw them live, and went out and got the album right after - it was not a disappointment. These guys are real pros, and bring something new to a lot of these songs while giving tribute to the originals.Great acoustic and electric guitar work."
1107,1,good covers: I enjoy listening to this CD. The cover songs sound original while keeping the fundamentals of the original songs. This is very hard to do for most musicians because they want to make cover songs into their own. Tommy Shaw and Jack Blades perform very well together.
1108,1,"Great Match!!!!: Being a big fan of Styx,Damn Yankees and Night Ranger,I knew I would love this cd. Received in the mail and thought it was great. Either acoustic,heavy,it doesn't matter to me. This is a fine collection of stripped down tunes from great songs of the past. Love it from beginning to end,but the standouts are,Summer Breeze,Your Move,I Am A Rock,The Sound of Silence,Dirty Work and Dance with Me. You can say I pretty much love the whole thing.If you love the music of these guys,with their bands or the original songs they covered,I highly recommend this one. They did a great job!!!!"
1109,1,"Great CD: Love, Love, Love, this CD. The song selection is fantastic. There is something for everyone. Whether these are the songs of your youth or you are new to this music, this CD will blow you away. The harmonies are amazing, their voices blend so well together. Jack and Tommy really know how to stay true to the song and also make it their own at the same time. I love each and every track. It has not left my CD player since it has arrived. A must have for your music collection.!"
1110,1,BEST CD EVER: InfluenceTHIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CD'S I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO. IF YOU LIKE THE OLDIES - THAN THIS IS THE ONE TO PURCHASE.
1111,1,"cross culture study of birthing systems: This was an excellent book to read in medical anthropology class. It gave a view of birthing systems in only some cultures, but that was enough to show some of the drastic changes between cultures one sees in the woman giving birth and the hospital personnel. Amazing how even with technology some of the fundamental needs of the patient are not being met."
1112,1,"Good Job: I was totally impressed with the service. Not only was the software in good condition and is working well, but it was sent in an incredibly short time."
1113,1,"Great Upgrade: Each version of this product gets better and better, easy to use and easy correct almost like your english teacher is standing over your shoulder."
1114,1,"Great...but still doesn't sync with Palm!: Basically like the program - Word is particularly useful in a world where anyone who wants to send or receive a document from you probably already uses it. Entourage is a more usable organizer than the Palm desktop in terms of material you can record in the various tasks, appointments, etc. (Palm's is prettier, but only a bit.) The big problem as of this writing (6/10/02) is that we STILL can't sync Entourage to Palm. As far as I'm concerned, that makes Entourage not-yet-usable, since daily syncing with a Palm is, for me and probably most users, an absolute must! So basically I've bought a word processing program with a convenient but, for the foreseeable future, useless (albeit elegant) desktop organizer. Wish it had a database program, too... in theory, Excel can do that, but it's nowhere near as friendly as Appleworks' database program."
1115,1,"HOW TO FIX UNEXPECTED CRASH BUG: Some very nice person posted this. So I feel it\'s my duty to spread the word.You may get a ""Word has unexpectedly quit your system has not been damaged"" message.

1116,1,"a little biased!: I admit I'm a HUGE peter weller fan so it should be no surprise I loved this movie! One of his most overlooked films,paced terrifically from start to finish.Lori singer shines as his co-star,you won't regret adding this to your collection(plus it's getting harder to find)."
1117,1,"Finally: If you're like me and have naturally curly hair, but use a flat iron everyday to make it straight, you can stop your endless search for the perfect split end reducer. You're hair will be even more luxurious if you couple it with the Phytosesame conditioner. I am so in love with the 2 products and they have transformed my hair so much that I don't even break a sweat spending the extra money.I use both of them almost every time I wash my hair, which I now just refer to as silk. If your looking for something you can use daily without weighing your hair down and leaving it with a dull look, you MUST buy both of the products!I haven't had a bad hair day since. And, when you want to wear your hair curly (or have no choice due to humidity) this is the best shampoo to help reduce the dreaded frizz.The shampoo and the Phytosesame conditioner will leave your hair super shiny too. I honestly think once you use it, you're search for the perfect shampoo for curly hair will finally end!"
1118,1,"Great Book: This book states in plain english how a client/server product works, from theory to real world application. The author describes the history of computer information systems, databases, and program development. He takes each subject from humble beginnings as a technical brainchild to today\'s ( 1995 ) systems, continuing to tomorrows forecasted technology. This is a no nonsense author, who doesn\'t seem swayed by new technologies and ""silver bullets"". His philosophy is down to earth and in plain english. I couldn\'t put this book down, even while reading it in 2002. The history lesson presented in this book is worth more than Amazon is asking for this book. Buy it today.It isn\'t technical enough to be used as a manual, however it is still a good read."
1119,1,"Good Book for Consultants: This is a good book for consultants, and should be a part of their library. I often recommend it to my students and use it in my workshops as an important reference. The chapter on writing proposals is worth reading."
1120,1,"Alan tells it like it is: Alan Weiss tells it like it is. If you want to learn from one of the best...read EVERYTHING Alan Weiss writes! Alan\'s insights and experience are second to none. I personally own just about every book Alan Weiss has written. He is not only a consultant\'s consultant, but he is also a gifted writer as well.Alan Weiss\'s advice, insights and knowledge will take years off your learning curve. This book is a must for your library.Lenny Laskowski, Author of National Best Selling Book:""10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking""President of LJL Seminars(tm)"
1121,1,"well organized: good key pointers, quick and easy read, good layout. the section on office equipment is silly. but he has a few very good points that make the book worthy"
1122,1,"Getting Started in Consulting by Alan Weiss, PhD: This is a must-have book for the right person. It is written by a professional for professionals though anyone with expertise in any discipline who's considering self-employment can benefit from much of the information. I have an MBA and recently retired after 27 years with the same firm; one would think with an MBA such a book would not be needed but it is loaded with valuable information and references that will jump-start any venture into self-employment and especially consulting.I have the 2000 edition and I've ordered the 2009, after comparing the two, I'll come back and update this review."
1123,1,"My All Time Greatest Book On Consulting: This is the book that finally made it ""click"" for me.I have bought copies for those I have coached and mentored and have seen them start right and quickly realize success for themselves.A great book that should grace the bookshelf of any person just starting out.To make it work you should be ready to work and actually use the tools and strategies provided."
1124,1,"Great Book!: This is another winner from Alan Weiss! It provides specific strategies to build your business.Although consultant is in the title, I don\'t think there is a business that would not benefit dramatically by reading this book. In addition, the title""Getting Started in Consulting"" is misleading. This book is valuable for EVERYONE, even those that have been in business for years!I agree with the reviewer above in all areas except the rating. I would give it a 10+."
1125,1,"Another exceptional Harte work: I have been a professional in telecom for over 6 years and I have bought several of Harte's books. I read like them because of his clear, concise style. This books diagrams are really exceptional. I would recommend it to anyone in the field, no matter what level"
1126,1,"The great beginning...: I started with Little Miss Sunshine and worked my way backward in DeVotchKa's discography. This album is a little different from their later work, with some musicians that are no longer with the band. But their unique sound started here, has carried on and become greater. Supermelodrama is more raucous, with more of an American indie-rock sound, but sets itself apart with violins, accordions, etc, and some cool guitars and beats. It's fun to hear, to sing, to dance to, and the lyrics are always great. I won't even bother comparing it, because it's unlike anything I'd ever heard before. There's not a bad song on the album."
1127,1,"A great record, they have come a long way from this.: This was an incredible record. When I first started to listen I could barely recognize Nick Urata. This had a much more ""Rock"" feel to it as opposed to a more orchestral sounding arrangement in their more recent records. But this is great and any fan of DeVotcKa should add this to their collection."
1128,1,"Great Disc!: Got this at a local music store 8 years or so ago. These guys rock, truly heavy rock and roll. Sort of along the same vein as Cream's long jams. They jam very well. The guitarist is very talented. I have no other albums by UFO so I have no idea if this is considered one of their masterpieces. All I know is that I like it a lot!"
1129,1,"Windows XP: See it done-do it yourself!: A very commendable, thorough book. Although I am already an experienced Windows XP user this hefty volume ""fills in the gaps"" and is a great time-saver.I would highly recommend ""Show ME!"" to new and intermediate XP users. Each page uses visual screen shots with small blocks of 1-2-3 ""see it done-do it yourself"" steps so you will spend much less itme reading and more time doing with this simple step-by-step approach.In addition, nearly every instruction page has a ""Did You Know?"" box with interesting time-saving tips.^o^"
1130,1,"maiden heaven: an epic power metal anthem that will bring a big grin to the face of any Maiden fan who might have been slightly let down with the Brave New World album. ""No More Lies"" is strong on the melody, tight with the performance, and generous with the catchy hooks. a tasty peek into the excellent Dance Of Death record."
1131,1,The essential Borodin: This is a 2 disc set and includes a LOT of really good music. It includes some that is not heard too often but should be.

1133,1,"Great Production But...: Blu-Ray is such a pain. There's always a hitch and in this release couldn't select the menu (With a mouse)... only after downloading a trial software with a virtual remote would it play. I imagine stand alone players would be OK. Never any problems with DVD... but never a dull moment with Blu-Ray. Anyway, this historic footage is not to be missed however you decide to view it."
1134,1,"Amazing details, feel like you're on board: I can watch this over and over. The blu-ray transfer is very good. The music doesn't get in the way, love the crew's personal tapes, the spoken comments make me feel like I'm there in all the scenes. The comments are not silly high-minded bragging nor sensationalism. There is humor. Above all, it is human, just technical facts and human thoughts. The presentation may be out of proper historical order of the flights now and then but it isn't a big factor.I watched moon walks on color tv, live from the moon, back in those days. I also watched people who wouldn't watch the live tv from the moon at all. Strange.Some of the lunar scenes are staggering, at least for me. Driving on the Lunar car rover is incredible.I wonder how young people today will view this blu-ray documentary. I suggest this is for them."
1135,1,"Pretty but empty: One day in the USA there will be a revolution in entertainment. At that time we\'ll discover how good it feels actually to use our brains for something other than passive, thoughtless goggling at spectacles. But until then we\'ll continue to get things like this. Very pretty pictures, potentially an amazing set of stories, reduced to ""wow, would you look at that"" cliches.This DVD is a melange of clips from Apollo VIII onwards, strung together as though it were all one disjointed mission. The footage itself is of course incredibly beautiful but there is a paucity of intellectual content. Very little information, less explanation of history and context, and ultimately it\'s junk food for the mind.With the footage available a really interesting and profound video could have been assembled. But until the revolution we\'ll just have to get along with this ""turn off your brain and open your mouth"" prettiness."
1136,1,"Poetic, plus the soundtrack gave me shivers: This uses all kinds of Nasa footage never shown in public before. Some of the most striking was 'engineering' footage, showing rocket stages separating, various capsules separating and docking, and in one case, a moonwalk during the Gemini program. This concentrates on how the astronauts felt during their voyages and is based on audio interviews done years later. Some of these space cowboys get downright poetic. The best thing about the movie is the Brian Eno soundtrack which perfectly captures the balletic awe of space vehicles and the sights brought back from the Moon."
1137,1,"Succeeds in intent & we sent the right folks up there: This beautiful looking and beatifully sounding film achieves its intent of capturing the feeling of the space flights of the 1960\'s. It was not meant to be a supplier of trivial information concerning pounds of thrust or specifications of spacecraft. This movie starts you out at at pre-launch, taking you through an amazing launch sequence, into orbit, off to the moon, around the moon and on it and then back to earth.Other than the visuals and the amazing Brien Eno soundtrack, what I like most are the commentaries by the astronauts. Listening to them, you understand that they realized the magnificence and importance of their journey. Whether NASA or the US government were flying people to the moon for Cold War sabre-rattling or not, the astronauts truly thought of their mission as one ""for all mankind."""
1138,1,"Go to the moon: The moon missions are not very familiar to the the average person. We all know the footage of Neil and Buzz walking around out there for the first time, but some of the more inspiring footage comes from later missions: Astronauts driving the rover around, picking up rocks, skipping and bouncing and falling around the magnificent desolation; knowing you are the only ones on the entire lunar-planetary surface, that you are among the very few who have ever been there or will ever be there.As far as documentaries are concerned, this has got to be one of the best I\'ve seen or can imagine. The extraordinary thing about it is that they make you feel as if you are involved. By not taking the viewer beyond anything but NASA footage and by not giving your ears anything but NASA audio, you really feel like you have shared in these magical, almost unreal journeys, missions carried out ""for all mankind."""
1139,1,"This is a Best Buy: Pros: Very compact, very comfortable, Great sound, Good envirnmental sound deadening.Cons: Messy cord arrangementI like these well enough in comparison to the old Brookstones that I am purchasing another set for my wife. You won't go wrong with these. For the price - a definite Best Buy!"
1140,1,"nice: I'm very happy with these overall. Good quality sound for NC 'phones. They reduce most background noise down to something way less bothersome.My only gripes: the huge battery brick you have to clip to yourself somewhere and is not so good for walking around, I wish they'd expand about one more click for people with huge heads... the case is solid but it's kinda awkward to cram everything in there (it should include a slot for spare batteries).Glad I didn't pay 3X the price for Bose."
1141,1,"Great sound!: I thought I would write a review as I have had these for several years now. They are a great pair of headphones! Sound quality is excellent and the noise cancellation is terrific! The ONLY drawback is the battery pack. With this thing in the middle of the headphone cord, you will knock it around and it will fall on the floor at least once a sitting. The battery pack with all of the electronics for the noise cancellation is just in the wrong spot. It has fallen off the table so many times that now I have a low buzz in it. Oh well, I got a few good years out of it anyway."
1142,1,"great: i bought these for my wife, and she loves them. they are more clear than conventional headphones."
1143,1,"Awesome headphones: Clear, crisp sound. Superior base. Sound not distorted when you use the noise-reduction feature. Works great on the plane as well as kicking back in the living room. I did a lot of research before buying these for my husband who was ready to graduate to something high end. I tend to agree with others that the Bose have a great ad campaign, but the headphones themselves don't compare to these. Also, they're lightweight and not clunky to carry around. Comes with a travel case that fits snugly into his messenger bag."
1144,1,"Highly recommended: I've purchased these Headphones primarily for in flight audio. I've used it while exercising on my Nordic Track and Total Gym machines. They are extremely comfortable, cut out most of the noise from the machines and allow me to listen to my music without raising the volume too high. The sound quality is excellent. Be aware that they don't cancel noise entirely but enough to enjoy the music that's why I gave it a 4 stars intead of 5. I am looking forward to try them on my next long flight.Highly recommended."
1145,1,"Sennheiser Headphones: Gave it as a gift to my son who flies frequently and listens to alternative music (deep thudding base and no melody - but I digress... this is a review of headphones, not music). He loves the headphones and in direct comparison with his partner's Bose, says the Sennheiser is as good as the Bose at half the cost. A no brainer in his opinion."
1146,1,"Excellent Noise Reduction Headphones for Travel: The best thing about the headphones are thier size and packability. They fold into a small space, fit nicely into the supplied case, and fit easily into my crampt brief case. The sound is excellent (second only to the more costly and bulky Bose), and the noise reduction is great. As with all sit on your ear headphones, they do make you want to take them off after a several hours of use. My wishes for improvements: A coiled cord that would make it easier to keep from tangeling; an adjustable volume on the cord; a cord that you could unplug from the headphone and replace, if needed. I predict it is only a matter of time before the cord gets pinched or damaged in some way and then...goodbye nice headphones. However, after much research, I found these to be the best NR headphones available for the frequent traveler, with limited space in the carry on."
1147,1,"excellent, all the way around: great headphones, especially for travelling. they sound great and the noise cancelling unit is relatively small, so they are not a big pain to carry around in normal circumstances, but they really shine on the train or plane, where the noise cancelling feature makes a big difference."
1148,1,"pleasing performance: Puts you in a pleasent place while listening. Won't cover up screaming babies or barking dogs and car horns,but the white noise that is ever present is covered sufficiently to make the experience much better than conventional phones. Highly recomended at the price compared to Bose which are no better."
1149,1,Great for the price: Great noise cancelling technology. The best part is that they fold up into a compact carrying case.
1150,1,sennheiset PXC 300: Good headphones in nice hardcover box. Useful in office with AC or in airplane ( airplane adapters included)
1151,1,"Winning the war against the NYC Subway: Anyone who travels on the NYC subway knows they can blow out their ears trying to listen to music over the subway noises. The Sennheister PXC 300 was given to me for XMas, and it has been a godsend.Pros:By my estimation (hardly scientific) the headphones cancel about 75% of the lower frequency noise on the subway. I get an instant boost in the quality of the music, while canceling out most of the mechanical noises. I will still hear some speech and mechanical noise, but it's no comparision.Very comforable.Cons:The mechanism holding the noise-cancelling circuits and batteries is seperate from the phones, and can be cumbersome. I usually clip it to my shirt.Case is not well organized."
1152,1,"Good product with an added bonus . . .: One unexpected benefit of these headphones is that with the noise-cancelling on, my hearing aid does not feed back. With most headphones, I have to turn down the hearing aid I wear in one ear to avoid feedback from the headphone cup. And so the music in that ear is much quieter. With this set (and perhaps other noise cancelling phones), I can leave the volume up on the earpiece, and I get a much more balanced audio experience than otherwise."
1153,1,"Great compact noise canceling headphones: I bought these headphones over a year ago for myself and just got this second set for my wife for Christmas. She has a set of Bose headsets, which are great and have excellent sound and noise canceling, but they are just too big and bulky when you consider all the other stuff she needs to carry for business travel. These Sennheiser PXC 300 headphones are very compact...they collapse and fold up and in their case it is smaller than a typical paperback book. The sound quality and noise canceling is maybe a small notch below that of the big Bose, but the very tiny trade-off is worth it. I love these lightweight, comfortable and compact headsets."
1154,1,"stupendously good!: I've had mine for almost a year now, still can't believe how great they sound. There are days when I will just sit and soak in the music through these things with a big goofy grin on my face...The non-noise-cancelling Sennheisers are slightly better but I bought these because I spend a lot of time on the elevated train here in Chicago and it gets pretty noisy sometimes. Sure beats the heck out of the Bose phones which cost an extra hundred bucks!"
1155,1,Decent headphones for the money: Sound quality very good. Noise canceling feature works quite well considering the size of the headphones. Major drawback is the separate power pack needed to power the noise canceling.
1156,1,"Deliver on promise of noise cancellation: I got my pair of PXC300s in the mail today. These headphones do what they claim: They knock out most all low-frequency sound in the ambient environment. When I first put them on in the kitchen, with the fridge, a/c, and fan going it was like inserting earplugs into my ear canals. Deep silence descended. Higher frequency sounds such as the human voice are definitely muted, but will still be heard.As for sound quality, it is a real pleasure listening to music on my laptop or Ipod. Good bass-, mid- and high-range response. Yes, the in-line battery holder is large, but it rests easily on the table, lap or pocket. Good for the office, train or airplane, but I wouldn't necessarily want to go jogging with them. Overall, a good set of headphones for the money."
1157,1,"Delightfully Wonderful!!: The Bis members, roughly 19 then, are full of life and hurrah in this full-length studio album! The New Transistor Heroes take indie pop to a whole new level. This is a definent buy. Don't you dare hesitate!"
1158,1,"Good addition to the aquarium: I'm very pleased with this plant and my fish love it too, often swimming through the leaves. It spreads out nicely while still remaining tall, and looks great in my tank."
1159,1,"Chaser: Woops, you know that other review I did that you wont see anyway. Well, that review was for this one. Lets just say, it's good stuff."
1160,1,"No Kitschy Kitties Here: Even if you don\'t especially love cats, you will love this book. If you do love cats, you\'ll be crazy for it. Silvester\'s photographs are so beautifully composed, it\'s amazing -- angles, colors, lighting -- all are wonderful. In focusing on sleeping or yawning kitties, he captures the relaxed atmosphere of the Greek islands to perfection. The cats you will see here look like and behave like cats -- they aren\'t posed in that cute way you typically find in cat books and calendars. On the other hand, the photographs are not ""arty"" in a cold, inaccessible way either (thank goodness). I can\'t imagine that anyone would regret purchasing this book. It would also make a nice gift for a cat lover."
1161,1,Hans Silvester's Asleep in the Sun: This is another winner photographed by Hans Silvester. His skill in photographing these Mediterranian cats shows his empathy & respect for these creatures. This particular book focuses on sleepy cats and the places they find to curl up and nap. The pictures are beautiful.
1162,1,"This Cd is a must for anyone wishing to learn the Palestinian Culture.: "" For Palestinians in particular, many of these songs will bring back memories of a time long gone."" From the Cd sleeve. This is what this music was like when I gave this Cd and played it, for my dear husband who hasn\'t been in the USA for very long. This Cd is very precious to us, mainly the music is pre-war which is not so easy to find these days. Their is many wonderful love songs along with other Traditional songs. It truly is a must for anyone wishing to learn more about the Palestinian Culture, the richness and a beauty of extraordinary people.It is also, Cd\'s such as this that makes people aware that the Palestinian people has been so misjudged in regards to some of the Political degradation put upon them which is so unfounded and that they should live on in a country that is called,""Palestine."" A country that was stolen by the Zionist, who through every effort is trying to wipe out these beautiful people."
1163,1,"John's Story: This Book was in very good condition for a used book, I was very please with it and the short time it took it to arrive. I will order again.Thanks, Carlton H."
1164,1,"Excellent: When I ordered the book ""John\'s Story"", and asked that it be shipped right away, I was, to say the least, very happy to have it -- right away! Because the books arrived so quickly, we were not delayed in beginning the reading in our group. This kind of service certainly does encourage me to come to Amazon again. Thank you so much.Sincerely,(Mrs.) Ruth A. Records"
1165,1,"John's story: This was a spectacular book about the apostle John, with the actual readings in the back. It is part of an excellent series of fictional writings about a factual person and time and how it relates to the Bible. I look forward to the next Jesus' Chronicle."
1166,1,John's Story: I learned some things about John the Apostle's life that I had not previously known. The Jesus Chronicles are a way of seeing into how the lives of the writers of the gospels could have been and make them seem more realistic and personal.
1167,1,"Great Relaxing Jazz Music: I loved this CD, I love listening to this disc whenever I'm relaxing. New York City Samba is tge best track of the whole CD. It has both Latin/Standard jazz Twists involved in the sound."
1168,1,"Incredibly Beautiful: Although meant to be a children's book, this visually stunning work can be appreciated by people of all ages. Ed Young weaves calligraphy, collage, and the written word together in a most incredible way, through the theme of 'the heart'.I discovered this book about a year ago at a history teachers' conference. This year I purchased my own copy and was told at the time that someone had just purchased it for a wedding (shower) gift. What a great idea!"
1169,1,This book feeds the soul: I love this book. It's a wonderful book for a person in recovery. The words and the art make human emotions and virtues understandable in such a nurturing way. I've given this book as a gift and I have one for myself. It helps to augment my daily devotion.
1170,1,"Tweezerman is the best: I've tried other tweezers but the quality control is not always there the way it is with Tweezerman. They always line up correctly! This is a cute and handy thing to carry in a purse or keep in a first aid kit. I got the green tea color, very nice. I like that it comes in a little carry vial."
1171,1,"The CADILLAC of Tweezers: These tweezers are the BOMB! They are sharp and precise and grip even the shortest, most stubborn hairs and pluck them cleanly out. I threw all my other tweezers away and will only use Tweezerman. They are the BEST!"
1172,1,"Perfect: The tweezerman tweezer is perfect. The only issue I had with it was the packaging. It was in a plastic tube that looked homemade. However, the tweezerman did do it's job and no complaints about the craftmanship for the first time use. I will see how long the craftmanship will last."
1173,1,"Definitely worth the Amazon price!: These are the best tweezers I have ever used. I had heard good things about Tweezerman tweezers and wanted to try them, but was daunted by the high price tag. After finding this pair of mini-tweezers for half the price I had seen them in stores, I took the opportunity to buy a pair and have been very satisfied with the results. The sharp edges allow for precision hair removal and have not appeared to dull in the weeks I have owned and used the product. Also, the ""mini"" tweezers are sufficient for everything I need. I don\'t see a reason to pay more for a larger pair. These tweezers are superior to anything you will find in stores in this price range. I highly recommend them."
1174,1,Love my mini tweezer: This product is really good - love how it has a good grip - mini tweezer is perfect to keep in my purse. Would recommend this product.
1175,1,"Finally! Tweezers that work!: Tweezers that tweeze should be an easy find, but it isn't. These work just like they should and they're easy to hold on to, too."
1176,1,"Unusual Items: I ordered this on a whim and I am using to remove splinters and such. It""s a Good Item and a lot of help."
1177,1,tiny but mighty and well built: used these alot already. they have a great tip and good grab.serious tweesin. and they fit into any go bag
1178,1,Perfect tweezers: I bought this tweezer two years ago and it works great. It's the best tweezer out of all the other tweezers that I've bought and tried. The way you hold them and the way the tweezer grabs is just perfect. I'm thinking of buying another just to have a spare even though it's a little pricey for a tweezer but It's awesome.
1179,1,"Great Tweezer: Very easy to use, great tweezer for a great price! Is only a bit smaller than a standard sized tweezer but it works EXACTLY the same. what's even better is it helps anyone who is going 'green'"
1180,1,"Highly recommended!: Purchased these for a friend as I have a pair myself and they are the BEST tweezers in the world, bar none. I think if you have longer fingers you might wanna spring for the regular sized slant tweezers but since my hands are small these are the perfect size/grip. I have used nothing but tweezerman mini slant tweezers for the past five years. I swear by them."
1181,1,Best Tweezer I have owned: It grabs hair better than any tweezer I have ever used. The mini is fine for me but it is small so you may want to get the regular size.
1182,1,"Excellent book: This book presents a wide variety of topics, but doesn't go into a great deal of detail about any of them. I still recommend the book as an overview to the subject area."
1183,1,"Great to have it on DVD: I reviewed this a few years ago under the VHS section even though my copy was on lazer disc. The content of this DVD is easily worth 5 stars, unfortunately the video quality is not as great as I had hoped it would be on a DVD release - But I would never want to be without this magnificent work in my collection."
1184,1,"Johnny Shiloh.: Such a great movie worth the wait, remember it well from years ago though still keeps me posted to the screen. Worth having in your collection a real gem."
1185,1,"A Perfect 10: Completely captivating, WITHOUT A TRACE is one of the best books I have read this year. Jane's insecurity in her ability to help the victims of these horrific crimes is heart wrenching, as she struggles with her inner demons to help each witness/victim remember the minutest detail of a memory they just want to erase. Ray, tortured by his own nightmares, is a true doubting Thomas, but is perfectly portrayed as the dark, brooding hero needed for a romantic suspense.Secondary characters round out the story nicely, and Ms. Erickson's creativity allows evil to exude when the murdering rapist plays center stage. Once I picked up WITHOUT A TRACE, I never put it down until the last word was read. Strong, earthy characters, vivid imagery, and a suspense-filled plot, weld together to make WITHOUT A TRACE a top contender for best book of the year, and I am pleased to award it Romance Review Today's Perfect 10.Catherine McHenry"
1186,1,"AWSOME: I read this book in record time. I picked it up and before I knew it all I wanted to do was read it. I was sincerenly amazed. I usually am a picky reader and I picked this book up for the hell of it. It was GREAT.Jane Russo is an artist. Not just any artist, she sketches killers face from a victims memory. Naturally is great at it. She has a knack of getting inside of victims heads. But not this time. A new case has Jane really stumped. The new case she is working on hits too close to home. She is working on a rape case. And along with that she no longer has the support of her friend lover Alan instead she has Ray. Rayhas been hurt too, very deeply and he refuses to heal. Him fueled with anger on the case, and Jane compassion they click.Read the book and enjoy while Janes own rape case iz unraveled and HER vicTIM is brought out, while Ray and Jane face new and old demons of both their pasts.YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK. IT WAS GREAT!!"
1187,1,"...and so it gos...: I have loved biographys for a long time now, this is one of my favorates. Her life style is intreaging, and it boggles me to know that each page in this book is true. Jane is far from being a good person, but her passion for life, love, and writing supass any wrongs she has done. If you love life read this book; and if you don't, find out what your missing."
1188,1,"Fascinating story particularly if you like REAL music: This is probably the most amazing book you have never read, but once you read it you'll never forget it. It tells of a young man who, after earning the title of Dr. of Music, comes to America on a ship and meets a Captain, hears an amazing story about a statue and learns the story of the statue - a Madonna - and meets the girl who could be the one who posed for the statue. it tells of love, and hope, and failure, and loss, and amazing acts of kindness from a truly kind heart.Get it - read it - be amazed by it."
1189,1,"So Long As Love Remembers: I owned a copy of this book 50 years ago and loved the story. I had loaned the book to a friend (?) but she never returned it and even denied having borrowed it. I have hunted the book for years, but everyone kept referring me to a book called, ""As Long as Love Remembers, which is the title of a book about Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln. When I saw it on your site, I cried. I would recommend it to anyone who loves love stories. It is well written and I can read it over and over. You have made me a very happy lady."
1190,1,"Best Beginners Entertaining Book: This is the greatest cookbook!!! It has tips on entertaining, drinks, breakfast, and everything in between. I absolutely LOVE this book. I purchased it in an Atlanta boutique right after it came out and have had several friends request it. I'm so glad it's on Amazon. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
1191,1,Good recipes: This cookbook contained several delicious recipes that were simple to prepare. Would be a good additionto a cookbook collection.
1192,1,Great Cookbook!!: A very cute cookbook-perfect for giving to friends!! The recipes are wonderful and very easy to follow.
1193,1,A Wonderful Blend of Voices: This is probably one of the best recordings by Rex and the Nelons. Losing Kelly and Jerry was a blessing for the sound of the group (even if it was just a short period). At least we got this great recording out of their departure. It remains one of my faves!
1194,1,"it works!: I ordered this with some trepidation, having used electric razors before and found them pretty useless...ineffectual.I used disposable razors for years but ultimately got tired of carving myself up & stopped shaving altogether. Then I read a review of the newer electrics elsewhere, which referred to this model as the ""BMW of shavers"". They also noted many people were equally satified with the lower end model-so I came to Amazon looking for that one, and found this, reconditioned for about the same price.I have to admit that I bought it fully expecting not to be satified but got a pleasant suprise. It is almost as close as a razor! All that said, if you\'ve been unsatified with other electrics, this one is worth a try."
1195,1,"Excellent book: A great history of the International Brigades, with a wonderful degree of detail on the troops' experiences in each battle. You'll feel like you were there, because he was there.I have to address the other reviewer who is hung up on the author's supposed bias. I guess he longs for a more positive spin on fascism. Good luck with that."
1196,1,"Content: 5 stars, Typography: 1 star: This edition (Modern Library Paperback) has several distracting typos. I had to refer to project gutenberg editions to find the correct text in several places. Other reviewers have done justice to the content."
1197,1,"Darwinism is alive and good today: I read this book, here in Brazil.The author, Darwin was an atheist and a racist.Writen at the same time and place, as Francis Galton and Karl Marx, Darwin didn't followed both of these charlatans, to the sewages of history.The theory of evolution began first in Greece and was also supported by another english, Wallace; but Charles Darwin, with this book really put evolution in mankind's mind.This book was read by Karl Marx, Adolf Hitler, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill,Mussolini,etc.Someone will claims that Darwin knew nothing, about the genes and DNA.Fossils found decades after this book be published, also put new evidences to evolution.Even so, the main claim of this book,evolution, was increased in believe, by time.Begined by this book, darwinism is alive and good today."
1198,1,"A must read: Even if one doesn't accept the concept and theory one should read this. It is an easier read than you might think, and the abridged version that this book doesn't take long to get through. It will leave one with a great understanding of what has been the most argued theory of the last century, and which continues to be argued even today."
1199,1,"Still good to get back to basics: Although a lot has been learned since Darwin's time, and a lot of good books have been written, it's still useful to go back and read the book that started it all. Darwin's text is clear and readable; and, since he was writing for people who'd never heard the idea before, he starts from first principles, as some modern writers don't."
1200,1,"a good read for a philosophical argument on sin: Its been a few months, but it was really interesting to read philosophical reasons for not sinning. Sin is contrary to nature and reason and the only reason we continually fall for it is hubris (pride)."
1201,1,think deep: i rate good because i consider a good book to read and makes pleople reflect and thinkit was used but in exellents conditions. thanks
1202,1,"Five stars PLUS: ""The Grand Inquisitor"" is a story embeded within THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. However, the story is ""self-contained."" Nothing is lost by reading it as a complete short story. In my opinion, ""The Grand Inquisitor"" is the greatest single story ever written. It\'s an interesting look at humanity, spirituality, and the church. If you are only going to read one more thing before you die, you must read ""The Grand Inquisitor.""*This particular edition, however, seems to have some typos that were not caught by the proof-reader, but they\'re nothing very serious."
1203,1,"Texas-style roadhouse blues AT ITS BEST!!: I've seen them live three times(even though I live in California) and have 3 of their CD's. I can tell you, this is the best thing they have ever done! No bad songs on this one. Great vocals; trading leads between Joe's Strat and Bnois' Gibson, great stuff. If you like Texas blues, this is the CD."
1204,1,"Tarkovsky's very interesting debut feature..: Exploring new techniques against an older framework, ivan's childhood may not have the same feel as other tarkovsky films but the stylistic innovation is still present especially in the dream sequences and in the interesting ways that water is photographed which would become a very prominent feature in his later movies as well..It is actually a very remarkable movie and one that the world took notice of (including ingmar bergman who was influenced a lot by this movie)..This is the work of a young director experimenting with a new cinematic technique.. The results are very interesting and Ivan's childhood remains a classic of 60's cinema.."
1205,1,"black and white wonder: after Stalin's death during the Kruschev era quite a few good Russian directors produced a good number of movies and Tarkovsky was from the era. This movie has been adapted from the book Ivan by Vladimir Bogomolov which is hard to get in English.Tarkovsky shows how much can be attained through cinematography, just by using light and shadow, if you do not have a huge budget. Considering that this was Tarkovsky's first movie out of the school - this is a monumental achievement. It bring in the real atmosphere of the war in the backdrop of Russian winter. Every screen is like a picture postcard and actors are really derivatives and are automatically integrated in the atmosphere.Some of the clips at the end of the movie is from WWII and I do not think that was necessary - but again it gives the perspective to the ending - which I will not tell you. After this rest of Tarkovsky movies are quite abstract and difficult."
1206,1,"Another artistic movie from the master - Tarkovsky: Tarkovsky has become one of my favorite directors because of the artistic, dream-like quality of his films. His movies are not for people looking for fast-paced, action movies. His character development and thought provoking aspects are excellent. But, it's the incredible eye for artistic detail that truly amaze me (and I watched a lot of films in general - and internation films in particular.) Highly recommended for someone who has an eye (and an interest) in film art of masterpiece quality!"
1207,1,Ivan's Childhood: Another Tarkovsky masterpiece presented with care and precision by Criterion Classics.Time for a Blu-ray upgrade.
1208,1,"A Great Guide to the Vampyre Underworld: I found the Vampyre's Almanac an extremely useful guide to the vampyre and gothic sub-culture. It contains resources on where to find clothing and publications that I never knew existed as well as a great music section. Coming from upstate NY, I did not know where to begin to find others like myself. This Almanac pointed me to places and things that have expanded my mind."
1209,1,"Father Sebastian's commments: The reason I decided to do this project was to create a guide to the vampyre scene which I felt lost in when I first got involved. As a club promoter, fangmaker, publisher and now author this is my tool to help others discover the dark world which has become my home and the a sanctuary for many like myself. Please enjoy and I look forward so seeing your comments.Eternally, Father Sebastian"
1210,1,"Fantastic Photos: The photos tell the story in this book: photos of immigrant children, roughly 1890-1910. Young readers looking at these photos will be able to make inferences about the children, their families, their lives. A whole period of history will come alive for them, in a way that mere words could never capture. Although Freedman divides the chapters into the passage over, home in the new world, school, work, and play, I felt there was nothing spectacular about the text. The text does not stay with me. The pictures do. Still, a very worthwhile book. Recommended!"
1211,1,Immigrant Kids: My girls and I loved this book. The pictures take you there and it is written so kids can easily comprehend to what it was like then.
1212,1,"Excellent Film: With the recent release of ""Flags of Our Fathers"", this movie should be made available on DVD ASAP. This is a fine film, and that is coming from one who is not necessarily a Tony Curtis fan. This film can be gotten on a poor quality VHS rendition from several vendors (I know because I got one), but it should be redone on DVD while the subject is hot. It appears this will be lost in the shuffle and it is a shame. Even the VHS version is better than nothing--GET IT!"
1213,1,"I Recommend This Book: My twelve year old son enjoys playing tennis, so I picked up ""The Kid From Courage"", as I\'m trying to encourage him to read more. I was delighted that he absolutely loved the book. He has actually been telling his friends about the book, a first for him! Although I haven\'t read the book myself, I highly recommend it based on my son\'s positive reaction."
1214,1,"Asimov demonstrates again that he has no peer in the area of explaining science: No one explains science better than Isaac Asimov, to most he was a science fiction writer, but his greatest contribution to the world was in explaining science to others. In this book, he fields a series of 100 science questions and gives detailed answers, even though each is only two pages in length. Some of the questions are:*) What are imaginary numbers?*) How many particles are there in the universe?*) Why do comets have tails?*) How will the Earth end?*) What is meant by curved space?*) What is the unified field theory?*) What's a breeder reactor?*) What is entropy?As a source for quick and complete answers to many of the common questions about science, this book is unequaled."
1215,1,"Paco de Lucia's performance of Aranjuez: I've only listened to the first movement of the Concierto de Aranjuez as played by Paco de Lucia, which is included in a Paco de Lucia anthology (thus I can only rate the first track of this CD, while not having heard the rest of the CD). Paco and the Orquesta de Cadaques really put the Spirito in the Allegro of the first movement. It's the best performance I've heard--full of rythmic energy and excitement. I think the flamenco guitar (I'm assuming that's the instrument Paco is playing) and technique are most suitable for the first movement. On the other hand, I suspect the classical guitar may be more suitable for the more famous second movement (John Williams' performance with the Seville Orchestra being my favorite)."
1216,1,"Summer Time: I LOVE Diana King. I already own the original 2003 UK release of Respect, but i am so glad to see it finally released in the US. This is Diana's best album todate. it is a real summer album. i love to listen to at the beach or in my jeep. hell im in ohio right now were it is 30 outside and i have been listening to it the last week. the lyrics are good, and the music is nice, and diana just keeps it real. this is definatly a GREAT album. the music ranges from hip hop, reggae, house/dane & even the few ballads. but its wonderful. everyone will enjoy this CD. Nuff Said!"
1217,1,"sucker punched.....: got this cd as a fluke. have never heard of this woman before and don't particularly care for reggae music. played it while copying to my computer and ended up listening to the whole thing... repeated a few of the tracks several times! there's something here, the rhythm? or rhymes that remind me of mark morrison (return of the mack). definitely worth a listen!"
1218,1,"Student and Reader of Jerry Braza: I am a student of Jerry Braza's and have taken several classes with him; it was his Healthy Relationships class that made me want to read this book. This book was everything I thought it would be. It is simple, straightforward, but not lacking in insight - which is very much the way Jerry lives his life. This book gives simple activities to do in order to relieve stress and to be mindful of staying in the now. Gold Star!"
1219,1,Excellent addition to any library: Dr. Braza has defined Mindfulness in a way that non-Eastern thinkers can identify with. He offers practical advice on how to cultivate mindfulness in today's fast-paced world. This book is excellent for beginners to this topic as well as lifetime students of mindfulness and the art of living moment by moment.
1220,1,"Mr. Charming: Back way back when there were East Coast types that placed a high premium on what the English would call the glory of amateurism. So slip on that lime sports jacket and checked pink pants combo your grandpa used to wear, pour yourself a cocktail and meander out by the pool for some light evening conversation. Full of classic anecdotes like the one where two golfers are driving cross country and the one riding shotgun has a driver in his hand. Sometimes when they stop at a crossroads he likes to get out and take a few swings. Well out he gets one time and the driver doesn't notice, just takes off for about hundred clicks before he turns back......."
1221,1,"Awesome, but what else would one expect?: It's a collection of Michael J. Fox movies. If you're familiar with his work, then you know you're getting a great collection!"
1222,1,"Michael fox-4 pack: Product was tremendous value--4 dvds for less than price of one! (And fun.) The Hard Way was a little too hyper for me, but the others were great."
1223,1,"Awesome quality/packaging for 4 movies!: I like ""The Secret of My Success"" and had it on video and finally decided to pick up a DVD copy. Ended up picking up all 4 movies in this collection for around $9. 3 separate DVDs contain the 4 movies. Watched ""The Secret of My Success"" last night with no problems. Container is fancier than another 4 movie collection I picked up at the same time and as a Michael J. Fox fan, I look forward to watching the other movies. Don\'t expect many extra features on the DVDs though - with some older movies, there probably weren\'t any beyond the trailer anyway."
1224,1,hilarious: anyone who loves michael j fox will enjoy this collection. it is michael j fox at his best and its well worth having
1225,1,"A sweet story with clever illustrations: I was surprised to see that this book is apparently out of print (I get it from my local library). The young children I teach enjoy it very much. I think it's great for preschoolers because in order to spot the mother fish on each page, they need to match the color and shape pattern of the little fish, which sharpens their observation skills and even relates to math (matching patterns). Whenever I read it, kids get very excited when they can spot the bit of the mother peeking out from behind a plant or another fish. Aside from that, it's a sweet story about a little lost fish looking for his mom, which is very meaningful and engaging for young children. I definitely recommend this book."
1226,1,"how to install easily with latch: I saw many negative reviews about instalations our with latch. And I would like to share my knowlegde with those who are struggling. That will be helpful for any carseat. I install face forward. In order to get your carseat tight, you must put one knee on the seat, with a help of elbow push down head part of the carseat and pull latch tight. You will be suprise how sturdy it will hold. I fould it out watching oficcial FAA video how to install carseat on a plane and tried it in a car. Before I was dissapointed with that seat and thought that latch does not hold seat on place. But when i tried trick mentioned above - carseat became a solid part of the car. 4 stars because it really does not recline enough! But othewise I think it is a good seat. Oh, yes. If using on a plane unscrew hand rest and leave at home."

1228,1,"Great Guide to Security Book: This is a great book for a facility manager who is concerned aboutsecurity. It starts with ""How to Perform a Risk Assessment"" and proceedsprogressively to more and more complex systems. It coversPhysical SecuritySeparationFencingGatesBarricadesLocksHardwareIntrusion DetectionClosed Circuit Television SystemsCounter EspionageHow to Set Up a Security ProgramBadging and Tracking EmployeesIt is a terrific book for a beginner or a manager wanting to be smarterabout security."
1229,1,"A Forgotten Treasure: I pulled this cd out. For a brief moment I had to relive the pain of him not being with us anymore. What ever you can get your hands on by this man is worth the price their asking. An incredible talent, he could actually play two horns at once. The majority of his work was with Jeff Lorber whose name alone speaks for itself. The standouts here include the title Pocket City, Inside Myself, Passion Sunrise, LA and my all time favorite by Art KGB. A consistent performer, I also highly recommend Undercover and the tribute album For Art's Sake. He left us a wonderful legacy in the form of what he loved most. His signature runs have yet to be duplicated by anyone and that is as it should be."
1230,1,"Fantastic Instrumental: Porter brings the clarinet alive. He literally makes the instrument sing in a language that you can almost translate into english. This music is uplifting, haunting and almost hypnotic."
1231,1,Just what I wanted: I have been looking for this CD for a while. Just what I wanted in perfect condition.
1232,1,Peter the great: great book interesting good detail I enjoyed it very much.The part of history I find important to understand if one would like to know how the real european history falls into place.Frederic of Prussia is next on my list.
1233,1,"A Nice Start: An early work of Gordon, it reflects on his fascination with the world of Medicine. Unlike his best work in The Physician and Shaman, Death Committee searches out modern cutting edge medicine. At times he seems in awe of the mortals who struggle to solve the puzzle of transplantation. He does an accurate job for 1969 when the book was published.I expected more incite to the characters. Having read his wonderful later works first, my expectations were high. Trying to put this in perspective as a second novel, it showcases Gordon's development as a character writer.It is a clever quick read and highly recommended for those who like Gordon's later works, but I would read the later works first."
1234,1,"Noah Gordon is GREAT: Noah Gordon's THE DEATH COMMITTEE is excellent! The plot is intricate, the characters believable, the research based action is accurate. This is the third of Gordon's books that I have read and I have yet to be disappointed. Increasingly it is difficult to find a novel that you want to read it forever, never get to the end, never have to go back to the beginning, reading that is as enjoyable as eating a good steak. Gordon always delivers. I would only suggest it for people who enjoy complicated books, but I certainly will tell everybody about it."
1235,1,"The Death Committee: Really appreciate Noah Gordon\'s skill with words. But this just isn\'t as good as his books entitled ""The Physician,"" & ""Shaman."" Sometimes one has to be in the ""mood"" for a novel...I did enjoy ""The Last Jew,"" & can\'t wait for his next ""Kindle"" novel. Wish I had his gift with words."
1236,1,"masterpiece: This is simply a masterpiece. Nomi is a protege of Sakamoto and here his orchestration shines. Track 1. bears all the stunning hallmarks of a masterwork. If you dont listen to the whole score (and please ignore the whole Country Roads rendition which is awful), at least open your heart to this gem. In relation to the story,the orchestration is a marvel and delight and traces the progress of a young girl waking to the morning sun--enthused and amazed--and proceeds to stroll down to street level--further enlivened by the morning sun to which she looks up to--and promptly, melodically gasps. Beautiful!"
1237,1,Future Noir is Kicking: Philip K Dick is one of the best storytellers of the sci-fi genre. His short works and most of his novels are interesting dives into the nature of humanity and reality. Great reading that will twist your brain or leave you perplexed. I recommend Philip Dick to anyone looking for sci-fi that is out of the norm. [...]
1238,1,"What, no listing of the content?: Essential reading for a PKD fan and someone who wants to see where the ideas for some of Hollywood's recent films came from. Some of these have way different endings and only somewhat resemble the films for which they're credited as the genesis.What I would like to see here is a LIST of what is actually in this collection. Amazon's information has nothing."
1239,1,"excellent, excellent, excellent!: It was easy for me to get quite excited by this short story set. These stories form the basic of three very fine sci-fi movies: Minority Report, Paycheck, and Total Recall. Being a big fan of all three, it was great to enjoy the original short stories too. There are also two other short stories in the set: Second Variety, and The Eyes Have It.Second Variety is definitely another fun thriller. Somewhat predictable, but fun nonetheles. The Eyes Have it is mercifully short, because it is a real stinker.As a whole though, this collection is a real gem, and a bargain as well."
1240,1,"pretty awesome: great album. i've got a few jorge ben albums that i love. I have gil's eletracustico, but i didn't get a real sense of gil's style until i heard this album. it's worth your time."
1241,1,"Simple & Subtle: If you have no patience for subtle music, stay away from this CD. If you enjoy dissecting songs, basking the minute changes in rhythm and texture, this disc is hard to surpass. Ben & Gilberto are playful and innovative without losing focus. This is an exceptionally under produced and improvisational studio album. This is not for people with a short attention span who want canned and predictable pop, Brazilian or otherwise. If you want to find something different each time you listen to a CD, I highly recommend it."
1242,1,"Just what he wanted: This little wireless computer has all the bells and whistles to help my husband optimize his bike trip to and from work every day. He loves to check average speed, fuel economy, and the like on his car's computer, and now he can do it on his bike too."
1243,1,"Comments about Music for Lover, Vol 2: This is a great cd for those moments when you want to spend with that special someone. It's also great for background music while you work on your computer. Also, not bad for when you're dusting and cleaning or doing those little odd jobs around the house that you've been putting off for so long."
1244,1,Great Kitchen: This is a great kitchen my daughter just loves it. It's also great because there is a sink on one side and the oven on the other so her and her little cousin don't fight over who gets to do what... there is room for everyone to play at the same time.
1245,1,"Great! Only one minor detail...: Bought this kitchen for my 1.5 year old little girl. Already after the first day I can see that many more hours of fun will come from this toy! It didn't take my husband too long to put together, maybe 2ish hours. It seems very sturdy and I love the compact size. My only complaint is the size of the shelf in the oven and fridge. We bought my daughter the Melissa and Dough apple pie set to go with the kitchen, but the apple pie won't even fit on the oven shelf. My daugter got very frustrated by this! I just wish the self was a bit deeper!"
1246,1,"ending the search for a kitchen: After lots of research and trials with other wooden kitchen sets, I am happy to finally have found this one. Super straight forward to put together, great size to grow with my 3 children, and great quality."
1247,1,Very Satisfied - Kids LOVE it!: It is a great kitchen for a small space. It is a bit smaller than I thought it was going to be but it is the right size for my 4 yr. old and 1 yr old. I love that it is real wood and if you ever wanted to paint it or even build on to it you could. My 1 yr old can actually fit in the oven and it has great storage space in the refridgerator. My older daughter loves the dry erase board too.
1248,1,"Great size, great features: This wooden kitchen is the perfect item for people who don't have a huge amount of space and don't want a giant plastic kitchen taking up room. It was pretty simple to put together and has enough features to keep my daughter interested (phone, clock, dials, oven, fake water dispenser, etc.) without driving me insane (nothing makes annoying sounds). Best of all, she can enjoy having a kitchen without it monopolizing our entire basement."
1249,1,"cutest little toy kitchen ever!!!: i love this little kitchen! great quality and my 2 year old liked it the minute i pulled the pieces out of the box. The assembly was simple and took about 30 minutes. The instructions are clear with good pictures of how to put it together. I like how the little shelves slide in and out, the faucet turns side to side, the sink can pop out, the doors all have magnets that keep them closed, the stove knobs turn and the ice maker lever pushes back like a real one, also the hands on the clock move. My child just loves this kitchen. Her favorite thing to do right now is open and close all the doors. It looks really nice too (not a big tacky hunk of plastic) and it's the perfect size. I highly recommend this product"
1250,1,"Wonderful...: This book is one of my favorites, and by far my favorite fairy tale book. It includes fairy tales from different countries, ones that are hard to find otherwise and are close to their original first telling. It shows that they truly researched and worked hard to come up with something so full of wonderful tales. The way in which they are written adds to the storytelling, and is hard to find anymore."
1251,1,"A wide collection that consistently remains true to the heart.: It can be difficult to find a fairy tale collection that manages to hit on a wider spectrum of stories, rather than the hish-hash collections of everything that everyone has memorized or the collections that go out of the way to find the most unknown and unusual. This has both, from the familiar to the distinctly different, and told in a classic Victorian voice. There is a story for everyone here, romantic, macabre, and even funny, and from a variety of countries and cultures. It's a good, basic show of different types of stories, and each one is memorable! Defintely a must-have for the fairy tale collector!"
1252,1,"The Greatest Book on the Greatest: I have also read Tao of Bruce Lee by the same author. I feel he really gets to the essence of each man's character rather than giving detail after detail. For most people it will be the only chance to gain the feeling of being there in their prescence. In the case of Bruce Lee this is particularly true, since he's no longer here with us."
1253,1,"More inspiration than perspiration!: Davis Miller shares the story of his life and the inspiration he has received through his serendipitous encounter(s) with Muhammad Ali. This is a poignant account of a boy's difficult childhood, and the inspiration he receives from his real-life hero, Muhammad Ali. This wonderful book is much less about boxing, and much more about family love. How wonderful it would be to sit in the living room of Muhammad's mother and feel the warmth of her radiating love. The author states that Muhammad Ali would have been a world-class figure even if he had never put on a pair of boxing gloves"
1254,1,a 'guy's' book women will love: Wonderful story. Tells of how Mr. Ali affected an 'underdogs' life & gave him strength to become a writer- even though he (the author) failed english as a subject in high school. This book is not just for sport/boxing lovers. My bookclub (all women) loved it.
1255,1,Exceedingly good fun: Buy both Tao of Muhammed Ali and Zen of Muhammed Ali and Other Obsessions - and all of Davis Miller's other books! They are amongst the most important pieces of literature to have been published in the last 100 years! Simply mind blowing. And incredibly fun.
1256,1,"Very useful information: I enjoyed the book very much and thought it gave a very balanced account of the issues involved the ""the controversy."" I wish the book were not out of print, because I would love to own it. I have recommended the book to others as a good reference on SBC issues. I wish it were more up-to-date, however."
1257,1,"Decent light: The light is decent, is good for providing a little extra light in a local area, definitely not for applications like camping but just fine for someone like a stage technician. I bought it for the UV light to check IDs with.It works just fine and had a solid feel to it. I liked the placement of the switches for the UV and white LEDs. The holster had a snap, but the snap was right over one of the buttons, so you have to be sure that when you put it back that the buttons aren't facing out when you put it back.Mine broke after about a year of use every weekend. The wires that connected the switch to the lights to the battery chamber had loose connections, and it was not designed to be fixed. For ~$25, I didn't particularly care."
1258,1,"Big!: The CompactFlash Expansion Pack (CF EP) is considerably thicker than I\'ve anticipated. The iPAQ is 5/8"" thick. The combined package measures 1 1/16"". That\'s 70% increase in thickness.Even so, CF EP is practically free after $... manufacturer\'s rebate (just shipping and/or taxes). Compaq should\'ve saved us the trouble by bundling it with iPAQ.That said, CF EP is immensely useful. I\'ve since unloaded eBooks and WMA files to a 64MB CF Type I card. Add Ethernet and soon-to-be released cards like GPS navigation system, the possibilities are endless."
1259,1,Gotta Get It!: My iPAQ is still so new that it's barely out of the box but this expansion pack has been of tremendous use to me already! I bought it before my iPAQ came into the store.I find that I can't live without this product when I use it to connect to my network with the compact flash network card. I travel constantly for work and with this product and the network card....it's a breeze to keep up with information on my corporate network or internet.I also find it useful with the CF cards for holding my ebooks that I read on the plane or delayed in the airport.Catch that rebate while you can!
1260,1,"Great: Best deep-ridges winter mat I could find at a reasonable price, Had to do a little snipping to fit great, and now it does. May want to find a way to prevent these from moving, like velcro, sticky spray, or another method."
1261,1,"her best!: My favorite, (""Verse"" being second). Her voice, composing. piano all in top form on every piece. Wins you over the first time through. I own and listen to most of her cds and this one is powerful and accessible all the way through."
1262,1,"Youthful, gorgeous, sad: A beautiful first effort from Cuadros, who died shortly before the book was published. Poems and short stories. He writes with anger and nostalgia about growing up in California, learning who his friends were, discovering himself as a gay man, wrestling with AIDS, and keeping people close. A tough book to read, but worth it."
1263,1,"Delicious...My Precious...: We get a can every holiday time and love it.You've got the savory buttery cheddar cheese popcorn, caramel corn and kettle corn. What more can I say? It's popcorn, and it's Catoctin and it's very very good."
1264,1,"Better H & G Dessert Cookbook: One thing I especially like about this cookbook, in addition to the great recipes, is the vintage look of the pages. Desserts are pictured in what I think of as old watercolor illustrations. Very retro looking. Fun to look at and cook with. Over 400 recipes."
1265,1,"essential information: Sorry, I am not in order but I don't know where to say this because I am not a great computer chap. I am a lover of jazz music and have, what I believe to be, a great collection. Amazon.com is doing a wonderful job for the jazz lovers. But I believe the NAMES OF THE ACCOPANISTS MUST BE FEATURED PROMINENETLY WITH THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY CD WITH BUYING INFORMATION. It should not appear incidentally in the reviews. We all know how this information is absolutely indispensable for judging jazz music. Imagine a Mccoy Tyner or Tony Williams not being mentioned. I sincerely believe that, however humble the accomapnists, they should figure in the CD information importantly. Then only meaningful critique can be attempted. Thanks.Krishnamoorthy, Advocate"
1266,1,"GREAT HISTORY: THIS BOOK TELLS THE GRUESOME STORY OF THE DEATH (OR NOT) OF KING EDWARD 2ND. IT MAKES A GREAT STORY & DOHERTY TELLS IT IN A WAY THAT KEPT ME TURNIING THE PAGES...I\'VE READ IT TWICE & NOW WANT TO READ DOHERTY\'S ""ISABELLA AND THE STRANGE DEATH OF EDWARD 2"" SAME STORY WORTH REPEATING."

1268,1,"LE grand voyage musical, sidérant et sidéral !: La plus grande dimension du voyage virtuel musical, digne de 2001 Odyssée de l'espace pour le cinéma, Mirage est l'oeuvre électronique qui m'a le plus transporté aux confins de l'imaginaire et du rve; hors du temps et spaciale, l'oeuvre nous fait toucher du doigt l'infiniment grand et l'infiniment petit.Grandiose!"
1269,1,"One of His best: ""Mirage"" is one of the three Klaus Sculze\'s masterpieces of the middle 70\'s golden period.The others include ""Timewind"" and ""Moondawn"".Only after 20 years KS has achieved the same level with ""In Blue"".It is an essential CD for those who are interested in German electronic music.A true mystic ""electronic winter landscape"" as KS himself calls it.Highest recommendations!"
1270,1,"again a milestone of electronic music: Highly praised album that was recorded in January 1977 and shows Klaus Schulze possibly at his artistic peak. Here we have two titles reaching the 30-minute mark that a musically very different from another (like ""Timewind""). From dark, ambient noises to melodies of unearthly beauty Klaus Schulze shows us all he has to offer. And what he delivered on side 2 with ""Crystal lake"" surely belongs to the top 5 five recordings of electronic music ever made, a track of almost mythical quality. If you\'re a fan of Tangerine Dream\'s ""Cherokee lane"" on the Encore album (and who isn\'t?!) you will play this piece a dozen and dozen times until you CD player begins to smoke. To sum it up: buy ""Mirage"" and lose your head."
1271,1,"stunningly beautiful: When I first heard this it profoundly affected me.The pure, blue, cold crystalline purity of this movement,is perfect in every way - the timbres, the ambience, the seemingly infinite scope of this music, all these make this cd mesmerising. This was the absolute peak of his career,the closest Schulze ever got to this perfect place again, was with thedouble CD X. Klaus is the absolute undisputed master of Berlin ElectronicMusic and music like this is the reason. a masterpiece."
1272,1,"Best Place to Start with KS: If you\'re new to the huge catalog of Herr Schulze this is the CD you need.Long sweeps of electronics with subtle rhythms and - this is what puts Klaus in a class by himself - a real sense of dynamics and build-up.Personally, I think ""Cyborg"", ""X"" and ""Dune"" are his masterpieces, but this is a very fine album and I can\'t think of a better starting point."
1273,1,Good stuff: This is the real deal AC Delco brand that GM uses. It went on my Trailblazer and is working just fine. Coming back for another one when the time is due
1274,1,"Read this book!!: I wanted Treekeepers to go on forever--I couldn't put it down. The story is told in a vivid way that makes it more like watching a movie than reading a book. The main character is an orphan girl named Bird who thinks of herself as tough and brave, which she is. But she also has a tender heart. As she battles her way through life, looking for her father and a way to heal her land, her heart slowly grows in tenderness. She finds people she can love--and who love her. But also, she fails miserably in her quest, until in the end, well, you have to read the book. There is something comforting about the way this story is told. It's like being wrapped up in a warm blanket in front of a fire on a cold night. I will soon be 40, but I still crave such stories."
1275,1,"Well-written and loads of fun!: My daughter and I both read The Treekeepers and enjoyed everything about it. The writing, the characters, the story, the emotion. It was an amazing first novel and one that neither of us wanted to put down. Here's hoping for more from Susan Britton, and a sequel of The Treekeepers."
1276,1,"Captivating...Until the ending: Throughout the story, The Treekeepers held me captivated with the story of Bird, the land of Wen, and Bird's companions. But the ending left me feeling unsatisfied, and the story felt unresolved. I got the sense that the author rushed through the ending, or tried to blur it because she was unsure of how it should go. All in all, I thought this was a very good book, but unless there is a sequel, I think the ending was a let down."
1277,1,"Every song a delight. Treasure this CD!: This CD has outstanding renditions of love songs, sung with feeling and style that only Shirley Horn can sing."
1278,1,"Here's To Shirley!: I bought this CD because I loved the lyrics to so many of the songs included in it. But I fell in love with it because of Ms. Horn. Great renditions. Great style. Now that I've bought several more of her CDs I can say that -- without question -- this is her very best.Just a totally lovely, memorable, haunting effort."
1279,1,"Perfection!: If you read the earlier reviews, almost anything I could say would be redundant. I believe this is Shirley's finest album (also my favorite). This is a woman who sings about all of the experiences and emotions that we have all felt......and makes it so extremely personal. With a ballad, she has no peers. Her use of time and space between words has always reminded me of the way Miles Davis played the trumpet.The orchestration should be required learning for those arrangers who aspire to use strings in a jazz album. This is the ultimate example!If you want to experience something excruciatingly beautiful, get this cd!"
1280,1,"Shirley Horn - A review by Kele Agi: Review from 2005-Clearly her best work to date, this piano prodigy and the ""Here\'s to Life"" CD is a front runner as the best album of 2003, but her English rendition of ""Ne Quitte Pas"" is phenomenal.Update- 2006Shortly after seeing Horn at New York\'s Metropolitan Complex - in Avery Fisher Hall, Ms. Horn passed away."
1281,1,"Classic Jazz Album - Shirley's vocals backed by orchestra: Shirley Horn is the great jazz vocalist least known by the general public. She is also one of great jazz pianists, primarily as an accompanist to herself. Here though the piano duties are not all by Shirley. Nevertheless, this is one of best works, her wonderfully nuanced, soft, slow vocals backed by an orchestra. This a definite 'must have' by any Shirley Horn fan or someone wanting to discover a timeless jazz CD. Enjoy!"
1282,1,"""Excellent reference"": the item was shipped on time...received as what has promised...i bought this for my niece who is a nursing student...it\'s a very good reference book for nursing...brand new and received in good condition...thank you"
1283,1,"A must have for all Nursing students!: During my very first clinical day of nursing school, I noticed a copy of this text floating around the nursing station. The second I opened it up I said ""WOW!"" Having just recently graduated (and passing the NCLEX!) I can honestly say that this was one of the most helpful books ever! This is Essential! This book never made it to my bookshelf because it was almost always being used! Excellent companion for writing care plans."
1284,1,"Lippincott still the standard for clinical nursing: After being out of the clincial arena for over 15 years I wanted to refresh my skills. I used Lippincott as a nursing student in the 70's and it was then and is now the standard for nursing practice. The book is easy to read, look subjects up in and the illustrations are great. I would recommend this book to any new nurse or one like me who wants to see how things have changed and to renew information. A great book."
1285,1,excellent: I ordered the Lipencott manual for nursing and i really likedit. It made it easier to understand some complex material thatis very hard to grasp in nursing
1286,1,"More than a basic health care reference.: I have had this book in the house for 23 years. It was the best choice I could have made as the mother of a sick child. I needed somthing a lot better than a general health book because I needed better quality information on a moments notice to help me keep this child alive. It helped me understand things quicker so I could work more efficiently with the health care professionals that helped us. This worked for me because the information was quick, concise, and accurate. My child is very healthy today and is asking for his own copy. That's why I'm out here shopping today...for him."
1287,1,Excellent Condition/Service: The book came in excellent condition and I receive it within 5 days of purchase. Could not desire better service.
1288,1,"Longlasting, easy to use: This is my second set of these in five years. I use them on my farm for a variety of rough duty chores, and they jold up great. The coated hooks prevent cuts and scratches which other cords may allow."
1289,1,"great: strong, great, good sizes, durability, served sufficiant for the price. Need to add two of each size for standard items."
1290,1,excellent set: I use the cords to safely hold my scooter cover in place while traveling. They work great as I needed different size cords for the various cover distances.
1291,1,Good value: These bungee cords are a good value because of the multiple sizes which are color coded. They are as described and will serve the purpose for which they were obtained.
1292,1,"Money as Sacrament-: This book came to me at the perfect time in my life! I am 43 years old, and on my own for the first time in my life, following the end of a 21 year marriage in which my husband and I played the traditional roles of male/provider and female/homemaker. I was very uneasy and quite frustrated at the financial place I was in. In addition, the topic of money is not one that many of my friends felt comfortable talking with me about, especially now that we were coming from different perspectives.Reading Adele's wonderful book was a blessing to me in 3 ways: it was full of good information and lessons, it changed the way I view money in my life, and I realized that many other women have been in similar, or worse situations, and they have found their way. It really lessened my fears and concerns, and helped me to trust that everything is as it should be. This is a much needed book on a very important topic."
1293,1,"Thoughtful and thought-provoking reading: Money As Sacrament: Finding The Sacred In Money is a book written by peace activist Adele Azar-Rucquoi especially for women. Encompassing the author's own personal experiences, the candid and informative interviews of more than 50 women are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, and exhibit a thoughtful scrutiny of just what money is and the potential it has. Thoughtful and thought-provoking reading, Money As Sacrament blends the practical and the spiritual into an even whole concerned with balancing needs of the body with needs of the soul."
1294,1,"A Little Jewel of a Book: After (gulp) I got past the title, here's a book that must've been written by a saint! It really doesn't feel like a book at all. More like an extended conversation. And full of wisdom yet none of it foisted on me. I've been accompanying Adele on a leisurely stroll in her beloved Florida, along the way bumping into all these women she's talking to who become intimate friends revealing their innermost concerns & hopes. What an original & lively foray; never thought a book about money could bring me closer to God! When I put it down I was ready to celebrate!"
1295,1,"Thinking about money: This book is fascinating on two levels. First, the reader can enjoy the life story of the author -- a real journey of growth and change. Second, the reader is led to begin to think about money in a new way. We all spend time thinking about money -- what it can buy, do we have enough, how to invest, etc. This book invites you to think about your relationship to money -- why does it matter to you, how has your family influenced your view, are you in control or does it control you? Very thought provoking and worth while."
1296,1,"Surprising: Given how old this book is I was surprised who well-done it is. He provides a useful overview of the historiography of the war up to that time, which I found to be quite good."
1297,1,A must read: I need this book for school and I ended up enjoying learning about my history that I was so unaware of. I learned a lot from this book.
1298,1,"A Tale of Courage: This novel tells of Damocles de Warrenne, and his life before, during, and after serving in the (2nd) Regiment of Heavy Calvalry, known as the Queen's Greys.I really enjoyed the way Wren examined so many different characters and their complexities.This novel has adventure, suspense, romance, and humor. Through it all, Wren tells the story of a Damocles and his quest to live up to his family's reputation in the armed forces. It's a good read and a fun adventure that has an amazing ending!"
1299,1,"A very good book with new comcepts about women.: In China, we say that women is half of the sky, and man, the another half. But in practice, there are much more to be improved. For example, female students from college are more difficult to find jobs. This book of Fisher gives new concept to realize female.As I translator, I want to translate this book into Chinese for more Chinese female to share these concepts. I hope Ms. Fisher can contact with me via e-mail."
1300,1,"what a surprise - male backlash!: I am amused by the backlash coming from predominantly males, and is it a surprise? Fisher's book touches a nerve - and deeply for those whom it threatens most - the male of the species. Good for her! And as for all the insecure men who are not going to like the inevitable changes to come... the human species thankfully continue to evolve. Deal with it. And women are stepping up again to take their rightful place in a world that honors the feminine AND the male, the yin AND the yang, the rational AND the emotional. For as Fisher says, this is what makes the world go round! And really, has the male-dominated world really done well for the human race? War, ecological destruction, etc. - where did these ideas come from anyway?"
1301,1,"Alberto Villoldo: I love Alberto Villoldo! His books are fascinating. He uses stories and exercises to illustrate what he is trying to relay. His books are very knowledgeable and his cd set kind of summarizes many of his books.His voice is so calm and pleasant, and the sincerity of what he has experienced and believes in is intriguing.The only thing I didnt care for about this set is some of it is taped during an actual conference with a public setting and in the first disc someone repeatedly clears their throat. Other parts of it are just his narration and much better than the publicly recorded sections."
1302,1,"Inspiring: I'm not a big Nicole Kidman fan, she normally seems very cookie cutter, but in this movie she had guts. She starts off as a stay at home mom very white fence and apple pie. The strange neighbor (Robert Downey Jr)above her helps her break out of that because he senses something reckless in her waiting to break out. The neighbor has an extreme hair condition. He's literally covered in it. At first he doesn't let her see him, then eventually he does. She doesn't freak out or anything. He's an interesting character definitely, vulgar, outgoing, daring. The chemistry between the two of them is intense. The ending is heartbreaking, beautiful and inspiring. You will be routing for these two. This is one of my favorite roles Robert Downey Jr has played. If you like the blacksheep type of people and indie kind of films then you'll like this one. WARNING FULL ON NUDITY"
1303,1,"Human / Mammal: Most people hide who they really are and only show what society expect them to represent. We are all people living in a society, but that does not mean that we stop feeling the human/mammal needs and wants.At work, we have to be professionals and be what the job needs us to be, but in the personal life, we should learn to accept who we really are.I can remember what John Wooden said:""Be more concerned with your character than with your reputation, because your character is who you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.""Fur is one of my favorite movies, as she learned to accept her desires, needs and wants."
1304,1,"bad amazon.com editorial review: i'm only writing this for tow reasons:1.) the amazon editorial review of this film is awful, it's more a cliff notes synopsis of the film rife with spoilers, and little insight beyond that. Trine, your review makes it clear you are a narrow-minded hack who knows nothing about writing an editorial review. shame, shame on you, and shame on you amazon for posting it.2.) this film is incredible. clever, artistic, bold and subtle at the same time, and wonderfully edited. the performances are solid, and the story is the kind of magical realism that makes films worth watching."
1305,1,FREAKING AMAZING!!!: You other love this movie or you don't . . . I absolutely love it and think this was RDJ's best work ever. If ur a fan of his u have to see it!!!
1306,1,"Riveting, Kinky Romance...: I started watching it because I always enjoy Robert Downey Jr.\'s performances. In this film he does disappoint, once again... But, Nicole Kidman shines also...This is a dark film, quite literally, and a quiet one. Downey, as Lionel, hardly speaks above a whisper and his soft, sinister voice greatly adds to the movie\'s suspense. His soulful eyes are arresting. Kidman\'s repressed and shy housewife of the 1950s comes across as realistic, and yet, strangely like the troubled princess in a bazaar fairy tale. (""Beauty & The Beast"")I positively loved this intelligent, sensitive, but, kinky romance. WONDERFUL!!!"
1307,1,love it: Got this as a gift for my grandson. He really loves it. As well as Mom and Dad. It help him with reading and math at a pace for him
1308,1,Perfect: Was exactly as pictured and came early and packaged correctly so very good im happy would use again in the future
1309,1,"Good game, but not Leapster's best: This is a good game, but not the most fun game Leapster has come up with. My son likes it b/c he liked the movie, but it doesn't hold his attention for long. I have noticed an improvement in his letter and number skills though."
1310,1,Excitement: My 4 year old nephew was extremely excited about this product and bengan playing with it right away. I like this product line and it keeps him entertained during road trips etc. Highly recommended.
1311,1,"very fun: I think it's a great Leapster game for pre-school kids. My son got it about 1 month ago, he's playing it everyday and not bored yet."
1312,1,"Son can't put it down: I had purchased this game two years ago when I bought a Leapster for my then 4 year old daughter for Christmas. My son at only 2 1/2 at the time started playing around with the Leapster and this game. Of course, given his age at the time it was a bit hard for him, but he figured it out pretty fast, which amazed me. He is now 4 1/2 and this is still his favorite game to play. Very educational, which is what I love about the Leapster in general. I could greatly recommend this game."
1313,1,"A must have: It is a great book. It does make the art of makeup less mysterious. The pictures are glorious full color pages. It holds the attention of even the most finicky teenage, and since he promotes a more natural look and I would encourage anyone with teenage girls in the family to get this book. I'm long past being a teenager and still learned things from reading this book."
1314,1,simplify your beauty regime: Yowsa!Talk about making it easy for us. This book gets right to the point. The title says it all.
1315,1,This replacement is better than original equipment: I bought this as a replacement suspension and was pleased that it had the rachet for correct sizing. I really appreciated the padded headband which will serve well as a sweatband.
1316,1,"What? No other reviews????: I cannot believe that this album has not be reviewed before now. This is one of the most inventive recordings ever made! I have plundered almost all the songs for my radio show. If you are even very slightly interested in innovative music, hit the order button now and get this album! Transporting and transcendent! I just wish that there were other An Chang Project CDs to purchase."
1317,1,"The more, the merrier!: Having an extra cradle/charger is very useful if your like me and would like to sync up at both home and work. The cradle itself is excellent. Although the Jornada 545 also has a USB connection, it is not nearly as fast as the iPaq's (makes me question whether the HP's connection is -really- USB)."
1318,1,"this book changed my life!!!!!!!: this book came to me through finding it in a box of rubbish outside of someones house.at the time i was in an unstable marriage with no direction in life.i read this book 3 times over after which it gave me the confidence to get out of a bad marriage and do something better with my life,which 10 years on i have remarried have a nine year career and a wonderful life.i can truly say without ben sweetlands words i would'nt be where i am today."
1319,1,"Grow Rich While You Sleep: I liked this book because it not only tells about using your subconscious mind but it also goes into how to live a purposeful life. Together, both of the subjects help you to handle life a little better or at least understand your way through it."
1320,1,"Get it!: Sir James George Frazer (1854-1941) was a Scottish anthropologist; and this book, originally published in 1890, as the two volume, ""The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religions"", his best known work.A short example of his writing style follows:""On Midsummer Eve people in Sweden""make divining-rods of mistletoe or of four different""kinds of wood, one of which must be mistletoe. The""treasure-seeker places the rod on the ground after sundown,""and when it rests directly over treasure, the rod""begins to move as if it were alive....""(pp 367, with reference notes at the bottom of the page.)This particular edition is the only unabridged, and illustrated re-printing of the classic, and while some modern scholars refute some of his conclusions, it is a Must Have for any student of folk-lore and magick."
1321,1,"Fascinating yet slow: Sit back and let Frazier lead you through a compendium of European myths and Classical cultures. It\'s fascinating for a while, but it\'s one of the few books I\'ve tried repeatedly to finish.Why is anyone buying this particular edition? The one listed as a ""Board Book"" with ISBN 0020955707 is IDENTICAL in text and covers, it just has a different publisher name. And it\'s significantly cheaper, if purchased used."
1322,1,Nothing Better: The scholarship of Frazier remains today one of the best sources of Western Nature Spirituality. Material such as this does not get any better. Highly recommended.
1323,1,good read: great book about magic and religion. the first type of book i've read quite like it. very fascinating book to read.
1324,1,"A timeless classic!: James Frazer\'s, ""The Golden Bough,"" is a must read for anyone interested in the comparative study of religion, folklore and magic. This abridged version of a multi-volumed master work will open your eyes to the commonality amongst traditional religious beliefs and practices around the world. One warning though: This book may cause an acute existential crisis for Bible heads. If you can\'t recognize pagan themes and rituals in the old and new testaments -blood sacrifice in particular- then you\'re better off sticking to bible tract comic books. I also love the cover art of Turner\'s ""Aeneas and the Sibyl."""
1325,1,"The Whole Story, with all the BARK on IT: OK, so you want to get the best total look at what once was outthere. This is where you start to study: The Moon, The EarthMother, the Grail, pick a card, any card. This is as close as you can get to someone that spent his whole life, gathering together the ""Primary Source"" stories that make up the very base or start of what we think we once were. Out of Fraser\'s work came a lot of ""Digging"" and additional looking, but no one ever got quite so much into the 12 to 14 volumes....YES that\'s right! St. Martin\'s Press, in the old Flat Iron Building in New York, should still have a few sets. Get the complete set. And an OED and a good link (DSL, ISDN) on the WEB to an ISP that is not going to go up in ""Smoke"" and ""Insider Profit Making"". Get this, and then follow your own best inner self, to where EVER it takes you, it\'s where only you can go anyway, but you be there: ""...and know it, as if for the first time..."" as T.S. Elliot used to say."
1326,1,"The Golden Bough by Sir James George Frazer: This is a wonderful book on the origin of beliefs, culture andclassic ceremonies. For instance, the Native American Indiansregarded a person's name as a part of their personality.In Bohemia, children carry a straw man out of the village tocast out death. Aphrodite and Old Paphos constitute one of themost celebrated shrines in the ancient world. In death andresurrection, Egyptians celebrated life after death. At Lagos inGuinea, young women were impaled by custom after spring equinoxin order to secure a good crop that year. Festivities wereprepared in order to coincide with the summer and winter solstices.The work would be perfect for students of world culture,fine arts, language and literature."
1327,1,"Golden Bough; a classic: Excellent oldie but goody....you can't go wrong with this condensed version of the multi-volume classic about magic and religion in human history. By the time you've read it, you will never think of human history the same way again."
1328,1,"Best book I ever read: This is my favorite book that I have ever read because of how much it opened up my eyes. Raised Roman Catholic, I was only taught certain things and believed that ""my"" religion was right and was so because of all these significant events. Well, this book showed me that numerous religions claim the same things, and helped me understand the traditions behind religions and how that most come from Pagan holidays."
1329,1,"read between the lines...: This book, however criticized and unaccepted for its main conclusions, is still the major contribution to the understanding of our evolution of thought. I find it essential reading for anyone who has read or is reading either the newer revelations of freud and jung, or the works of plato and other ancient philosophers.I notice that many readers are immediately offended by Frazer's apparent disdain for the 'uncivilzed savagery' of non-European cultures. However, this is a superficial conclusion to bring from this masterpiece. A little mulling over of The Golden Bough will show us that the savage's culture that Frazer so often refers to is none other than our own western culture. Frazer reveals to us our own social, cultural, and religious blindfold, which is none other than a pretty rendering of the ancient magics and superstitions explored in The Golden Bough."
1330,1,"fun for knights: We purchased this set for our five year old son\'s birthday, and he and his brothers (2, 8) love playing with it. We\'ve had it for over a year and they play with it consistantly. It is a great set that is very durable, easy to put together themselves and more versatile than I realized it would be. (They use it for all kinds of things and in different ways.) The characters are not poseable like the Melissa & Doug set (which my oldest has), but I haven\'t noticed that they prefer one over the other. It definatly comes with more characters, including a dragon. They get both castles together and play kingdoms (their words). This is a big castle and the only thing I would change if I could would be that the insides of the towers were more accessable. (The blue ""lids"" come off to allow for figures to be put inside, but you cant access them from the sides.) Still, I would definately purchase this again."
1331,1,"Impossible: Hoping the best, expecting nothing, getting everything! As always with Bruce, it\'s not in and out music! Listen to the album, 3 to 4 times. I\'m not in doubt...it\'s better than Born In The USA, ranking up there below The River....yet!I haven\'t succeeded in listening to ""You\'re missing"" without getting tears in my eyes. Hopefully I never will!It\'s really christmas!"
1332,1,"Very important book for understanding existence: This scientific book is especially enlightening and valuablebecause of its parts on the racial evolution of humanity. Darwin, oneof the greatest minds ever, had views on race that were very inspiring to people like Hitler (e. g. Mein Kampf), Chamberlain, etc. Among other Darwin showed that men (whites) were the most evolved whereas ""savages"" (blacks) were close to monkeys in the evolutionary scale. And this has been proved by anthropology: our ancestors, like ""Lucy"", were Africans. I also recommend Why Race matters (by Michael Levin); Duke\'s My Awakening; The Real American Dilemma: Race, Immigration, and the Future of America (by Jared Taylor); international Jew; White Power; and the books by Richard Dawkins on evolution, which defend Darwin\'s views against the attacks by fundamentalists."
1333,1,"Darwin's knowledge: I always wanted to read this book due to its intriguing title, thinking that it would address the very issue from the begining. Conversely, 90% of the book is about birds, animals, fish and other organisms...It gets very biological towards the middle and really detailed with birds...No matter how dissatisfied you are with Darwin's work you still have to read it. Analogous with an Al Pacino movie, even if it's not a good movie you will still be interested in watching it...All in all, it's worth spending the time with the option of quickly flipping through the birds chapters!!"
1334,1,"A joy to read: Sandburg took criticism for filling in some blanks with his imagination, but so what? His biography of Lincoln was not intended as a scholarly treatise. Think of the mystic atmosphere of a campfire at night, with an elder telling about the greatest person in a tribe's history. That is Sandburg's accomplishment, making Lincoln live again among us, at least while we are surrounded by Sandburg's mesmerizing account. No one interested in Lincoln or in the meaning of America should miss the experience of these volumes."
1335,1,"Abe Does it Again!: At first I had to develop some kind of a dedication to keep up with the readings. I found it a rather intriging read but some it was a little sad and informative at the same time. The book kind of reminds me of a political science book that I still have. Carl is a brilliant writer, yes he is and I have deep respect for him. This book can prove that Marilyn Monroe is not a dum blond because she was once friends with the writer and she may of had a copy of this book to remember her friend Carl Sandburg. I had to have patience in reading this book because Carl Sandburg is such a deep thinker in his writing formats."
1336,1,"Neat Little Book: This is a neat little book (182 page). It's a short little tutorial book. It's not deep in-depth, but it has some useful tricks in it. For example, I couldn't figure out the best way to make my orange roll off the counter in my Ant cartoon. I used what I learned in the ball rolling tutorial to figure it out.The printing quality, graphical layout, and organization in this book is the best I've ever seen."
1337,1,"Worked for Me!: I bought this book, studied for a couple of hours a day for three weeks, made flash cards and learned many of the words on the vocabulary list, took the practice tests on the CD without too many problems (over a period of 6 days), took the GRE, did well, and was admitted to graduate school. It required steady work, but I believe that the book was well worth it in terms of going in to the testing center on the test day and being fairly comfortable (though nervous) with the types of questions and ways of approaching them. I actually found that the math on the actual GRE CAT was easier than I had expected. My plan was to take the GRE only once, if possible, and with the help of this book, my scores were better than anticipated. Because I graduated from college many (30) years ago, I am certain that without the book, I would have had significantly lower scores in all three of the areas."
1338,1,"Assasin: This movie is about scientists creating a bionic killing machine that (gasp!) turns on them, escapes, kills on his own, and needs to be tracked and caught by the scientist who created him. It\'s cheesey and very ""80""\'s but I love it! Well acted with actors we all know but not sure from where and even throws in a robot love scene! great!!!"
1339,1,Security+ Review: Great product...It was easy to install...I purchased this product to replace a defective wall control panel. It was a perfect replacement.Thank you Amazon...
1340,1,"As expected...: The product was delivered in a very timely fashion. Actually, a few days ahead of the expected date. As for the opener itself, it work just fine. Easy to install and no problems. The additional functions are not working but, I believe that is a wiring issue since my garage door is not a Chamberlain brand and the wiring my be different. I'm sure I can correct that. Overall, great purchase."
1341,1,Perfect fit: This control panel was exactly the same as the original one that the builder installed in our house. So of course it works perfect!
1342,1,Electrical Contractor review: Works just like it was described - quick easy install - very little knowledge needed which translate to nearly anyone can install it.
1343,1,"Good Service: Came quickly, no problems at all. Very competitive price. Note that the Chamberlain and LiftMaster versions of this switch are interchangable. I have both. Note that the Chamberlain version has better illumination on the button (the whole square lights up), while the LiftMaster only has a small LED in the center. However, I didn't think this was worth an extra $10!"
1344,1,Exactly what we wanted.: Our original control panel button stopped working. I installed it in about 1 minute and it has worked perfectly since!
1345,1,"My dog goes insane for these!: I used to be able to buy these at Petco, since they stopped carrying them I have to buy online. These are my dog's absolute favorite treats. I've tried to find something similar, but nothing else makes him as happy as Sniffers. I usually buy three bags at a time, hope they never discontinue this product!"
1346,1,"Dog loves them & they're easy to break apart!: My puppy absolutely loves the Puppy treats. The treats themselves are easy to break into smaller pieces, and I can get away with using one or two for a 10min training session because the puppy is happy with very small bits of these treats. They also are more natural & low-fat than many other treats I've looked at. My only hold back is the price; I had gotten these on clearance for $2 a bag at Petco, but I now can't seem to find them anywhere else in stores."
1347,1,A pretty good adventure novel: Overall this is a well written and pleasingly paced novel. It supplies the reader with a good dose of Indy's cleverness and charm while creating a mostly engrossing journey. It does drag in parts but overall this a good addition to the Indy universe.
1348,1,"Introductory Statistics: This book is a used book. However, it is in perfect condition. It still contains all the pages including the formula pages in perfect condition. In addition, this book has the cd rom included which is new. I am satisfied with the price and quality of this book"
1349,1,good.: the book arrived earlier than i thought and in pretty good condition. only thing was the side of the book was ripped but other than that i can not complain.
1350,1,"Great Book!: This book was a steal, as the vendor shipped it rapidly and I received it before my class even started. Will do business in the future if I need to."

1352,1,"Informative, beware binding: I bought this book to use for a horse class at a local college. My first warning is the binding! It doesn't take long, or too many times of opening the book before the glue comes undone and sections of the book fall out. I tried my best to be delicate to avoid this from happening but, it still came apart.Some of the information is written in a confusing manner and some things are not entirely up to date. The non-updated information is not abundant and one can still learn plenty of information by reading this book.The book does cover everything from the possible cost to the mechanics of a horse, and many other things. It is a good book to have if you're new to horses. But, I would only buy it if you can find a cheap price on it. Simply because of the binding falling apart."
1353,1,"Complete Coverage: The book is complete in its coverage of everything horse related. The section on saddles, parts of the saddles and bridles was very good. The sections on horse racing statistics, harness racing stats was a bit too much for me."
1354,1,very useful book: Bought for school. It was a little rough being used and all. But it still works good and has a lot of really good information.
1355,1,"The one to read: I have recently finished the Vampire Almanac 2000 edition and was quite satisfied. It takes an informative angle on the gothic and Vampyre scene and creates a time saving and complete digest for any need you may have. From event listings, music reviews and bands to watch for, book reviews, a full calendar, the most comprehensive list of links and listings for clothing, literature, organizations, art and e-groups..and my personal favorite, a list of drinks from around clubs and bars and how to make them. I think the most suprising thing about it was that you do not have to be in the scene long to appreciate what you find inside though it will give you a better understanding. Even those outside the goth and Vampyre scenes will enjoy and find it an informative read. It is written in a fashion as to not be over the top and theatrical, just a useful and complete guide to the Vampyre scens"
1356,1,"Serial Cradle Woes: While it is a bummer that Compaq does not have any serial cradles available yet for NT4.0 users who don't have USB support, I bought a serial cable and it works just fine. I had no trouble getting it to synchronize with my workstation running Windows NT, although it's slower than USB, I guess. You can get the cable right here from Amazon."
1357,1,"Serial Cradle: I used this product for 13 days and returned it to Staples before their usual 14 day return policy expired. This is a great product, however, since I have a Windows NT machine, it is useless. (Windows NT can't use USB and I could not find a serial cradle anywhere.) I also wasn't thrilled with the size of the IPAQ. It is twice as thick as the Palm V. Way too big to put comfortably in my jeans pocket. Furthermore, it needs a cover to protect the screen. The Palm V leather case is the best example of how Compaq should design their unit/case."
1358,1,"A fun and cool widget: I like this little knife.I keep it on my desk and fiddle with it all the time, the blade lock makes a nice clicking sound.The spring clip is pretty weak and will come undone in your pocket, but I don't typically keep it in my pocket so I'm not worried about that.It's a great tool for your desk, your car, or anywhere you need a small utility knife and want one that looks very cool."
1359,1,This one will be a favorite!: My daughter just loves this book! She loves Poky and wants to sing the ABC song over and over again! Fun and educational at the same time!
1360,1,Beautiful watch for the Beautiful girl in life: i bought this watch for my wife. she loved it at first sight. it was a perfect fit color wise and size wise. very sophisticated looking. she felt compelled to remove it while taking a bath although it is fully waterproof. the chain is a little flimsy and has fallen loose once. i want to have it welded. also the chain anchor has attached itself to clothing and cardigan twice. this is unavoidable and we just have to be patient and separate them slowly. i would give it an additional star if the gold plating does not fade in a few months.
1361,1,"Keith Jarrett\'s best: For those of you who find the majority of Keith Jarrett\'s work self-indulgent to the max, this is the cd to get. Not a wasted note--just brilliant songwriting and sustained melodic invention from beginning to end. Beyond stunning. For more indulgence-free Keith Jarrett, check out ""Death and the Flower,"" ""Gary Burton & Keith Jarrett,"" and Airto\'s ""Free"" (Keith Jarrett plays electric piano on one or two cuts). If you would like to read more reviews like this, check out JazzboNotes.com."
1362,1,"Jazzy Jarrett at His Best?: The one that started it all. While not an emotional tour-de-force like Vienna or Paris, Facing You's genius lies in the melodic motif; throughout the album Jarrett explores gospel-tinged melodies that are bristling energy. The album is punctuated with concise, masterfully executed movements that never lul for a moment, never bore for a beat or even repeat themselves. Easy to listen to (for almost anyone), this album features a Jarrett going light on vocalizations (there is far more singing than groaning here, and more often-than-note its thankfully in key) and playing some of the happiest, fastest (plenty of dazzling, jazzy and classical-inspired runs) and most interesting improvisation of his solo career, which was literally launched by this album. A MUST have for any jazz piano fan."
1363,1,"This whole album is great but....: you need only listen to ""in front"" if you want to know what the big deal is about jarrett. it is the most amazing piano improvisation ever recorded and being a amateur pianist(who isn\'t?) i used to listen to it several times a day. it was like reading the bible"
1364,1,"Solid Solo Debut: Fresh out of Miles Davis' electric menagerie, Keith Jarrett recorded FACING YOU, his first solo piano album, in Norway in the fall of 1971. While less awe-inspiring than later works like THE KOLN CONCERT, it's a strong and wide-ranging collection of mostly rhapsodic original pieces which wander through the musical landscape in the master keyboardist's already-distinctive style and sensibility. Well worth checking out if you're curious; this man doesn't fake it."
1365,1,"Keith Jarrett: This album is in a very different field from his amazing, brilliant, and deeply inspired Koln Concert and Arbour Zena. It is good in its own manner, toned down and of a very different nature."
1366,1,"sparkling!: I used to have this album on vinyl, and hadn\'t heard it in years.What a great job they did transferring it to CD! It\'s crystal clear,and sounds so great on my stereo I could have sworn Keith Jarrett wasin my living room!And what a gorgeous collection of songs! They flow seamlessly together, and I love them all, but ""Lalene"" is just breathtaking. Whatever I\'m doing, I have to stop, sit down and just listen.A superb album!"
1367,1,"A riveting tale of maternal love and personal evolvement.: Ms. Kitt takes us on a poignant and moving journey through her life. She holds no punches as she shares the her humble beginnings and her serendipitous rise and later fall and then majestic rise again in her celebrated life. Her descriptions of places and incidents allow the reader to feel and become a part of her world. She offers us the true meaning of love when she describes her life encounter with her daughter and entrusts us with her non-traditional formula for raising a happy,loving and independent child. Occasionally, her truths are so raw and heartfelt they bring tears to the readers eyes, but her later triumphs make our hearts soar with pride and love. Ms. Kitt is a truly phenomenal woman and one can only hope that she picks up her pen one more time and shares with us what life has been like for her in the newest chapter of her life. A GREAT MUST READ! :)"
1368,1,"There is Life After ""the Wad"": I found this book to be of great comfort! I thought I was losing my mind and acting completely irrationally over a man/relationship. When I read this book I realized I had plenty of company and that what I was experiencing was actually ""normal"" emotions. After what was the most devastating relationship/breakup of my life, four months later, I find myself so much happier without him. Now that I am on the outside looking in, I wonder why I didn\'t get out of that relationship sooner. I may not know what I want in the next man, but I know what I don\'t want!"
1369,1,"Read the second after its over!: This book offers good advice for women in their 20's who have broken up with someone or been dumped. (not appropriate for an older audience, though). Very helpful advice written in plain, conversational English which can be read FAST. Best to read this a soon as you break up with someone, as it tells you why you should not do all the stupid things that us girls do (like call him, stop by, beg for forgiveness) and points out that MEN WANT WHAT THEY CAN'T HAVE. It offers advice on what to do if the ex lives with you or works with you, has a quiz to figure out if you want him back at all, and gives tips on how to handle dating others. All solid advice you may know already, but it is a huge help to read it over and over. This book does help you to speed the healing process by facing reality...which none of us girls are good at doing after losing the man we loved. I sure hope you don't need this book...ever...but if you are suffering please go ahead and read it."
1370,1,"d- music lover: I have been trying to find this album for around 10 years , and finally i hit the jackpot. On this album nearly all the song are great, except for two but those are fantastic. Night moves and Like other fools, these two song to me are the meaning of smooth jazz as i know it!"
1371,1,"Superb, Fabulous, Leaves you wanting more: This CD was stolen out of my car last year, and for all this time I have been looking to replace it -- no one else had it but I finally found it and I can't tell you how happy I am. If you like jazz, this is one CD you must own."
1372,1,"You would barely know this to be a british based band!: An example of good music without borders. Although there are a number of great vocal tracks, the total instrument track ""Silk Emotion"" is worth the purchase alone. It rates up there with most ballads you will hear in the ""smooth jazz"" format. As most of the reviewers have stated, this CD is a killer."
1373,1,"new art riot: back in 1990 manic street preachers (no the then) were the most exciting band in the world. they wore white jeans and fur despite living in a rough welsh mining town. one of the band couldnt even play his instrument. they lived on vodka and got straight A\'s because they were bored.this ep contains much of the best of that era. little can match motown junk for the sheer balls the track broadcasts. ""sets your heart beating for 168 seconds, stops your mind thinking for 168 seconds""if you the soppy brit-pop tosh that the manics put out now then dont buy this ep. but if, like me, the early tracks hotwire straight into your spine, then this is the absolute top buy for you."
1374,1,"Great for the money: I purchased one of these about 7 years ago from Sears and I had excellent service until last spring when it finally gave up the ghost. I recently bought another exactly like it from Amazon for about $15.00 less than I paid back in 2000. For this price I can not think of anything to complain about especially if I get another 6+ years from this one.I generally use it to start my lawn tractor but in a pinch I have used it to start car and truck engines as well ( 4,6 & 8 cylinder ). If I had one complaint it would be that the cables are very short, making it somewhat difficult to jump batteries that are in an awkward spot. Otherwise at $21.88 (free s/h ) I'd be nuts to whine."
1375,1,"Every woman should have one: This Mity-Mite has saved me more than once since I bought it. It is small and compact and can be kept in the trunk. It recharges using an extenstion cord so theres no transformer to store or lose. It would make a great gift for Mother, Sister, Girlfriend or anyone who doesn't want to be stranded with a dead battery. I have given several as gifts myself to both men and women. It's 12v power can also be used when camping to run air pumps or recharge a cell phone when you don't want to run you car battery down. It's a great product!!!"
1376,1,"Jumps Thru Hoops: I've been using a Mity-Mite for three years and have never had a problem until now. It won't charge. I've used it to jump my Toyota Tundra (V8) and Honda Civic when the batteries were deader than rocks. I've also jumped my riding mower, which is an accomplishment in itself since the stupid seat has to be down (on top of the battery - jumpers and all) to get it to start. Hopefully, my next Mity-Mite will work as well. I wish it had an attachment to blow up tires."
1377,1,"Good overview: This book provides a good overview of the early Kansas City jazz scene. I had forgotten how many great players came from, or passed through, KC. The names are all familiar, but I now have a better understanding of how the names fit in the development of KC jazz. Personally, I appreciated the pages dedicated to the history of KC and the information that explains how and why the town was ""wide open."" Had the city not been this way early on, the music scene certainly would have turned out different. I also like the inclusion (p. 201) of early Down Beat writer Dave Dexter\'s explanation on how KC style jazz (or Southwester jazz) was different than New Orleans and Chicago jazz. Several years ago I got to visit the American Jazz and Negro Leagues Baseball Museums in the 18th and Vine neighborhood; I wish I had read this book before I made the visit. I feel a road trip coming on . . . ""I\'m going to Kansas City. Kansas City hear I come . . ."""
1378,1,"Good Book: I was looking for a simple rebuild manual for this series of GM I6 motors. Since this is the only thing close that's available, I bought it. I'm only restoring my engine, but if you want to hot rod your motor, this has some great info and tips. Even if you're like me and only interested in restoration, it's better to overshoot when it comes to knowledge."
1379,1,"Chevy inline 6 Manual: Very good book, very informative and lots of handy little hints to follow when rebuilding my motor."
1380,1,very helpful book: It is a good merchandise very low price. It a great opportunity to learned all those trick that can help you to fond a solution on restoration and repair project.
1381,1,"Guys, if You Can Find a Copy Get It: I picked this up at a clearance table at the local bookstore, and it it fantastic. As is probably true of most wives, mine loves to be pampered. She's athletic, and often needs some muscle attention, but I am also athletic. The real problem is that my sport of choice is karate, and I am often a) exhausted, b) bruised, or c) broken and very rarely in the mood to hunker down to give a lengthy massage.That's where this book comes in. It is full of simple 5- or 6- step routines that leave my wife feeling relaxed and happy. I'm serious when I say that only 15 minutes of massage is good enough to put my lovely insomniac to sleep.The vote of a selfishly motivated husband is: two thumbs up![EDIT: My wife gives it two thumbs up, too]"
1382,1,A very usefull book for pooka players: I find the book very usefull if you play a pooka. It gives special rules in ore depth and their own flaws and merits. I would highly reccoend getting it if you play or intend on playing a pooka.
1383,1,"The Spirit Of Philadelphia Vol. 1: Philly Soul for your ear hole. If this is for you, buy volume two. Lots of quintessential 70's Philly Soul. Some you may have heard of, some not. But it's all good."
1384,1,"Good program for beginners: I've decided that, as a relatively new runner, that I need to work more on my core fitness. I am also always on the lookout for new things to incorporate into a boot camp class that I teach. My fitness level is high enough that these exercises weren't all that challenging, but I have still spent a couple weeks in levels 1 and 2 before moving up because they will provide a foundation for the higher levels. The exercises are very clearly illustrated and explained. After watching and doing the exercises with the DVD, then you follow the sequence of the same exercises in a set amount of time as laid out on the accompanying card. You will need a fitness band, an exercise ball, and some dumbbells. I haven't tried any other core fitness programs, but I would recommend this one. I'm looking forward to continuing the programs and increasing my core strength."
1385,1,"Core Essentials: Level 1/2: I have the whole series of DVD's as well as the books.. i think there some great information there.. however, I'm not 100% in agreement with the program design progressions.. As a corrective exercise specialist, I prefer my clients to do their 'Core' exercises at the end of their training hour.. Additionally, as simple as some of these seem, sedentary clients still need coaching. I have people that can't figure out what 90 degrees are without me.. Brett Cohen"
1386,1,"truly appealing poster: Yes, it's an art print and its 4 images are excellently spaced. The elegant background image along with the overall color make this an eye-catcher."
1387,1,"As a glamour photographer myself...: As a glamour photographer myself, this is a book I own and use for inspiration. I love the way Hurrell not only captures the inner-beauty of the subjects, but his photojournalistic approach. I often graze through this book as I've read it many times over--the grazing gets me going when it comes to my own glamour photography. I recommend anyone interested in this book, buy it now! If you'd like to see how it's affected my career, also check out the following books,Garage Glamour: Digital Nude and Beauty Photography Made Simple,Rolando Gomez's Glamour Photography: Professional Techniques and Imagesand even a book where I have a chapter,Professional Portrait Lighting: Techniques and Images from Master Photographers (Photo Pro Workshop series)This book should not only be on a collector's list, but for any student of photography--we're always learning no matter what level your photography. ---Rolando Gomez, contributing writer, Studio Photography magazine"
1388,1,"ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL: This book -- how beautiful. I have photography books by several of the great portrait photographers of the 20th Century, and this one is the best. There are a wealth of photographs, and the story of Hurrell's life is also interesting. If you ever thought about seriously learning about photography and taking some good pictures, this book will take any hesitation out of your mind. Gorgeous!!"
1389,1,Hurrell's Hollywood Portraits: This book is everything I expected. The pictures are great and the text very informative. I am enjoying it very much and it is a valued addition to my film library.
1390,1,Gift: Awesome book to learn about birds and learning about the many different kinds of birds. And it will help them on there nature walks!
1391,1,"GREAT HAT IT REALLY IS OFFICIAL: This hat is great. Nice fit, nice color, and best of all it really is the same cap the players use on the field. Great for showing mets pride. Very inexpensive but high quality. If you are reading this debating weather to buy it or not just go out and get!"
1392,1,A Friendship Rebuilt: Nita and Kit have been apart a lot after the death of Nita's mother.Nita is trying to deal with the loss of her mother while trying to hold the rest of the family together. She also begins to have strange dreams as someone or something seems to be trying to contact her.Kit is sent to check on a new young wizard who seems to be stuck in his Ordeal. The boy turns out to be autistic and a major target for the Lone Power. Kit is again joined by Ponch who is turning into quite a marvel.Kit and Nita's paths come together and their friendship reflourishes as they help Daryl and challenge the Lone Power once again.Some very good character development and realistic situations. I actually enjoyed this one more than the previous book. I am now looking forward to the next one.
1393,1,"Good Grief: I just finished reading this book last night. I read it straight through in one sitting. I found the plot twists and turns a little predictable. I saw most of them coming. This predictability did not take away from my enjoyment of the story. I generally enjoy the writing of Diane Duane.What really spoke to me in this book was how Ms. Duane so accurately captured how it was for me when my mother died when I was a teen. The numbness, how nothing seemed important any more, how hard just sleeping or any thing was hard to do. The stages and feel of what grief is truly.This complete description of how the death of a mother effects and affects Nita's and Diairane's lives and behavior is what makes me urge others to read this book. Please read it even if scifi/fantasy isn't your usual taste."
1394,1,"Lush Album: Every Moment Worth Hearing: This is a terrific collection of Billy Strayhorn compositions presented in surprisingly varied arrangements. The glue holding them all together is the late, great Joe Henderson and his forthright, beautiful, well-thought-out sax playing alongside bassist McBride. The pieces with Marsalis also really shine. There's never a dull moment in this rich recording, appropriately named Lush Life. Buy it and enjoy."
1395,1,Terrific but expensive and brittle: Not only does this glass work great for sake but it also is nice for beer or drinking water. The Riedel name means this will be expensive. Be very careful washing this glass as it can be easily shattered.
1396,1,"Nice to have Riedel crystal when we go out: My wife and I really like wine. However, most places do not serve wine and good quality classes. Yes, good quality crystal makes a difference when you're enjoying a nice bottle of wine. We wanted a solution so we could drink wine out of good glasses when we went out. I thought about using an aluminum case with foam padding to bring my good wine glasses from home. I found the Riedel to go series on a website and thought I would give them a trust.I give it four out of five stars because it is basically a Riedel O glass in a cardboard tube. The ends are made of metal so that does make it a little bit stronger. However the glasses do not fit snugly into the tube and they do move around a little bit. I read on other reviews that this is not a problem. I cut some foam padding to line the can to help protect the glasses."
1397,1,Love it...: The sound quality is fantastic and really brings my home surround system to another level. Highly recommend this product to every one...
1398,1,"American Garage........: I\'ve listened to numerous musical recordings by the PMG from age 10 until present day. ""The Search"" was and still is one of my favorite recordings. A reviewer said that he likes to listen to the PMG while traveling. From his description, while listening, he\'s instantly transported into a movie like setting. Back in the day, circa 1978 or 80, I was really in love with life, my family, friends and the thought of just being alive. The last time I heard this song was about a year ago or so. Still to this very day, I can remember as a child, closing my eyes, listening to this particular tune, and envisioning how life should be. (And then I grew up and soon came to the realization that life most definitely is cable of throwing a couple of curve balls now and then. Seems more often that not sometimes.) Never the less, I still enjoy this song for its worth and to me, it\'s worth the memories that I once had and the memories that are yet to come. ( ^ _ ^ )"
1399,1,"The Early Work of a Musical Genius: I bought American Garage shortly after it was released. At that time, I suppose few people realized the musical force Pat Metheny (and Pat Metheny / Lyle Mays) would become. Especially in comparison to Pat's later recordings, American Garage seems a bit dated and perhaps a tad too influenced by jazz/rock fusion style prevalent at that time. Still American Garage is a remains an important work for two reasons: 1) this album captures a developing Metheny/Mays signature style which would thrill audiences and critics alike for the next two decades; and 2) this album exposed a legion of pop-weary audiences (particularly young listeners) to the possibilities of Jazz. If you were fortunate enough to catch any of the Pat Metheny group concerts during this period you know exactly what I mean.Pat Metheny has only gotten better, but if you are a serious fan, this CD is a must have."
1400,1,a little R&R: I've been a Pat Metheny fan for years. I have most of his releases and find myself coming back to this CD alot. I think American Garage has a more of a rock n roll feel to it. I think Pat was experimenting with a garage band sound. The sound is probably not as polished as some of other efforts but I think it shows that Pat Metheny can mixed it up when he wants. He is always trying to add & experiment with new ideas This CD exemplifies that and show Pat Metheny in a slightly different lightI think this a worhty effort with lots of interesting guitar work. I particularly like Across the Heartland and Airstream. Most of the songs are easy to listen to although they may seem a little improvisational at times they usually have a nice flow to them. I would recommend this CD particularly as introduction to Methenys work and if you like a little rock & roll with your Jazz. I like New Chautauqua...Pat Metheny Group....First Circle....Imaginary Day as well. Also Travels (live) is excellent
1401,1,"America The Beautiful: Not being much of a jazz fan at the time, in the late 80's I was coerced into seeing a Pat Metheny concert and left the show quite impressed. Since then, I've collected a number of his albums and I listen to them quite regularly. Along with Travels and New Chataqua, this is one of my favorites."
1402,1,"One Of His Best!!!: I have listened to Pat Metheny for almost 3 decades. I have found most of his earlier works a bit more interesting to listen to. The songs are more melodic and he didn't use all that guitar synthesizer sound nearly as much. Despite the recording and production of this CD...the songs (Cross The) Heartland, Airstream, and The Epic are among the best on this particuliar CD. Certainly, this will have to rate as one of Metheny's best!!!"
1403,1,"Good single to compliment cd 2: Black and white town were a lot of main stream listeners first glimpse of doves, a good song but not a starting point.At the tower sounds like it should be on the soundtrack to a western remake. Excellent song and much more stronger sounding than most of their soft or electro heavy bsides."
1404,1,"Excellent: Great song from a great album. Kinda reminds me of Swervedriver mixed with Mercury Rev. If you like either of those excellent bands, you will probably like this. Unbelieveable how good alot of the UK bands are, and how they are virtually ignored here. Like these guys."
1405,1,"A touching story: Faye has written a touching and uplifting story about her struggle with bipolar disorder. She appears to have been afflicted with a pretty severe variety of the disorder, perhaps Bipolar I would be the proper diagnosis. The writing isn\'t as good as in the finest mental illness memoirs, such as ""An Unquiet Mind"" or ""Girl, Interrupted"", but she is still able to tell her story vividly and honestly. The reader is likely to find himself cheering for her, hoping she can get her life back together. Anyone with bipolar disorder should read this book. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
1406,1,"Manic by Midnight Defines Bipolar Disorder: I laughed and cried while reading this incredibly honest, inspirational story of Faye's recovery from her manic depressive illness. I was left with a better understanding of the disease and with the feeling of hope that happiness exist for those compliant with their medication after their diagnosis of mental illness. Faye made me belive that others that find themselves in a similar situation can make it too."
1407,1,"Great Item for the price: It was hard to find a sink this size, Just perfect for my small kitchen. I don't think anyone would be dissappointed"
1408,1,"Ignore the poor reviews: If you're a fan of axe-shredding and are curious to hear how fast it gets, this is your disc. No, Michael Angelo Batio cannot construct the musical masterpieces of Joe Satriani, but who can? Angelo is an okay songwriter in his own right (listen to the title track). Angelo and fellow fretboard wizard Shawn Lane are the world's fastest guitarists (faster than Paul Gilbert, John Petrucci, and Michael Romeo, and those guys are FAST). Not only is Angelo fast, but every note he plays is clear. You'd swear a machine was playing this music, but it's in fact a man. Amazing!"
1409,1,"Upbeat, a great addition to an eclectic collection: I saw this group in concert while visiting relatives. They are amazing performers and apparently have been doing this over 50 years. I bought CD's for friends and relatives I knew would be uplifted by this music. It's good stuff!"
1410,1,"Hard bop jazz not funk: Mo' Roots is exactly what the title describes it as being. Mo' Roots is a pure bop jazz album and a brilliant one at that. Unlike other Maceo Parker albums, Maceo sticks to bop jazz and incoporates few elements of funk into this brilliant work. Not to say there is anything wrong with his other albums, however this is to die for. Perfect for intoxicated social gatherings. This is the best album i have heard in ages. Simply brilliant."
1411,1,just what I ordered: I couldn't get enough at the store and it was a closeout item. I couldn't find it at any other store. Luckly it was still available on amazon .com
1412,1,"Bicycle Lights and Reflectors: This product was easy to install and works pretty well, the light is not as bright as I thought it would be but it does the job. The rear red light has two functions, flash and standard, this feature is pretty cool."
1413,1,"Great set. I should have bought another....: I got mine at a great price. But time will tell if it could last a few years or will start to fall apart and be landfill fodder. The last time I bought one, it was fine the first year, then the next year, it was dead. new battery didnt help. just died from the winter I guess. But this seems well constructed. battery might be expensive to replace. I think it uses litium ion button type."
1414,1,"great price on a 18* hybrid: quality is high on this club as it looks really good and performs well also. the interchangeable weights and extra weights/ torx screw driver, pouch and headcover makes this package great.though a better shaft could have made this club a lot better."
1415,1,good quality: I'm very happy with this product and have used it to decorate valentines and birthday cards. These stickers are suitable for moregrownup or nostalgic designs as the colors are somber (mostly browns). I've had my booklet for years and years and still haven'tused them up yet ... a good value.
1416,1,"Very good novel and excellent for teaching Freshman English: Ms. Smith's novel is written in first person; the narrator, Susan, is a young girl who is unknowingly witnessing the disintegration of her family and is just beginning to experience adolescence. As a Freshman English teacher, I have great luck with the novel because the students understand and sympathize with Susan. The biggest problem with the novel is that Ms. Smith's narrator jumps out of voice, but it happens seldomly and actually makes for interesting class discussion about the differences between writers, readers, and characters. Its principal asset is that Dogbushes deals intelligently and sympathetically with a young girl's emotional and physical growth. It is a short novel and I find that the students actually read it because they like it. I teach the novel because I liked it when I read it many years ago, and I enjoy sharing it with my classes."
1417,1,"Another great book by Irving Stone!: I think I'll just have to read them all. Irving Stone is one of our best contemporary writers. Read his The Agony and the Ecstasy, too, another great artistic biography. He makes us feel Van Gogh's angst, his struggle to express himself creatively, to hone his craft, to function in society. His infamous heartbreaks. The love and long-distance support of his brother. It's a truly poignant portrait of an artist - set in a spectacularly beautiful world."
1418,1,"An excellent book: An amazing story and very well-written. This book will take you through Van Gogh's life, inform you about this amazing but troubled artist, and leave you with your mouth open. Good for all ages and types of people. The only tough thing about the book is that it is sort of a slow journey... you might find yourself wandering a bit in the early chapters, but it is immensely satisfying if you can forge through them and take an amazing ride through this guy's life (don't skip any chapters)."
1419,1,"Lust for Life: After seeing the exhibit, I was wanting to learn about his life - the book, LUST FOR LIFE is very good reading and interesting."
1420,1,"Provides a meaning to life: Lust for Life has been and remains my favorite book.A fictional biography of Van Gogh, the great artist who 'cut his ear off', is not only well written, but a great motivator.Stone's sensitive and entertaining of Van Gogh's life helps provide some anchors in a search for meaning. What is truly impressive is that Van Gogh, despite his near 'silver spoon' origins and strong family connections with the art World, persisted in doing his own thing. He used to starve, while using his allowance for canvas and paints. And that too without knowing that he will be one of the Masters. This belief in self was truly insane.I am not courageous enough to follow such a path, nor have a comparable passion (or talent) to focus on. But this book helps in defining what life can be aimed at, and hence provides a meaning to life."
1421,1,"Wonderful, wonderful book: I haven't read many biographies since I was in elementary school, but I suspect that even if I'd read hundreds, this would still rank as one of my favorites. Absolutely riveting, and it gave me a much greater appreciation and admiration for Van Gogh himself, his difficult life, his work, and his wonderfully indulgent brother, Theo. Highly recommended if you have the slightest interest in art and Van Gogh in particular."
1422,1,"The best kitchen printer for the money: In all my restaurants' kitchens, I need to have a copy of the ticket for the salad prep person, and another one for the line cook. This printer allows me to use two-ply paper that prints both copies in one go. I have used this specific model in 4 of my restaurants for the last 8 years, and I have been extremely satisfied with it. The paper is available very cheaply at Sam's Club and comes with a replacement ink cartridge in each box. If there had not been power surges that had fried absolutely everything that was plugged in, or the occasional bottle of cooking oil or balsamic vinegar that fell on them, I would still be using the original printers, as they are extremely robust and well built."
1423,1,"My son loves it!: My son is turning 2 in a month so we bought him this sand box. He LOVES it! we cant tear him away. My husband and i also like it, Because it looks good on our patio and it doesnt stand out.Its a good value for someone with a small outdoor patio or deck that is covered.The shape makes it take up less room than the animal shaped ones and its bigger!Although, I do agree that the plastic it is made out of is not as good as the animal shaped ones. This one is thinner but its not that flimsy like some say. However the cover IS flimsy and i could see water maybe getting in if it rained hard. Or the cover blowing off in a big wind. We have NOT had that problem because we have a covered patio.That is why i gave the durabilty of the toy a 3 the cover could be made better. Other than that it is great."
1424,1,"Adorable sand box!!: We ordered this sand box for our son's first birthday. We had a nautical themed party to celebrate and the treasure chest was a hit! My 4 1/2 yr. old daughter loves digging for buried treasure! The lid is great to keep out animals, rain, etc. Great buy!"
1425,1,Cool album: One of Klaus's late eighties works and a soundtrack to boot it offers some of Klaus's more attmospheric music from that era. Taking the best stuff from the eighties and mixing them into a soundtrack Klaus created a decent album comparable and better than much of tangerine Dreams soundtrack stuff from around the sametime. A forgotten gem.
1426,1,"Very interesting book: Very good book for someone interested in Marie Curie's life. I recommend it for students and teachers of chemistry, physics, nuclear sciences and history of science."
1427,1,Too cute Valance: These valances were ordered for my 5 year old son's room to match the army/camo theme he so desired. They look great and match the bedding we ordered from another manufacturer perfectly. They are quite thin and long but I ordered 2 to make it look fuller on his window. They are a great addition to his new room and well worth they cost!
1428,1,Very pretty valance!: I bought this to go with the matching bedspread and was very pleased with the quality of both. They make the room look so pretty-my granddaughters just love them!
1429,1,"looks nice: the valance material is a little thin, but still looks nice to top my window. if it was a curtain to keep light out, wouldn't work that great. But, I use them with blinds..."
1430,1,"Cute, but not the stated size: This is a cute curtain although it is an orange/pink rather than the pink it shows in the picture. My problem with it was that in the description it is supposed to be 84 inches long and it is only 55 inches long. Now I have to order a second one so that it will be long enough to cover my window. It does look nice in the window though."
1431,1,"Thinner Material Than I Expected: This item arrived as described, but I was surprised at how thin the fabric is. Since the photo is not taken in direct sunlight, it makes the fabric seem higher quality. The item still works well for my application, but if you are looking for a heavier or richer looking fabric, this might not be your best choice."
1432,1,"BEAUTIFUL: I bought these for my nursery 2 years ago. They have held up nicely, the length/width was good as they fit my windows and still are able to pucker like they need too. They are absolutely perfect! I strongly recommend them."
1433,1,Glastonbury: Although I have not finished reading this novel I can tell you that it is beautifully written. It has brought me into the realm of the day and helped me to see the people and places as if I were there.
1434,1,"THE sub for the under $300 category: I have owned this sub for 7 years now, matched with my Paradigm 7.1 setup. I love it. You cant find a sub to outperfom it without getting above $400, in my opinion. Great value."
1435,1,"Excellent sub for the money!: In building my home theater recently I needed a sub that looked nice, wasn\'t too big but also sounded good and wasn\'t terribly expensive. Enter the H100, it fit all of those criteria to a ""T"".The high gloss black finish and grill look great, the sub doesn\'t take up too much room (which is nice for us as we live in a condo) and was a good value.The sound is wonderful for home theater and is respectable for music. If you primarily listen to music there are probably some other subs in this price range that may suit you better. For home theater though I think this is as good as it gets for the price. Now as you move up in budget there are a LOT of great subs out there starting in the $350+ range but not everyone has that kind of money. For those looking for a good ""starter"" sub, I\'d highly recommend this one."
1436,1,"A great speed demon: This will greatly increase the speed of tranfer, from your i-paq to your desktop PC. Just imagien tranfering the averge files in around eight seconds. When partnered with the AC adapter this couple are cheaper than the cradle and making it easy to bring on road trips. The i-paq is the only handheld to be supported by Macs and the USB cable destroys the need to buy and use a serial cable converter."
1437,1,Great Archtop Strings: These strings are excellent for an archtop jazz guitar amplified or not. I have tried them all and find these the best for tone and playability.
1438,1,"PLEASE NOTE - DON'T BUY IF YOU HAVE A DIMAGE Xi: While described as fitting the DiMage Xi, this case DOES NOT! If you own the DiMage Xi, you'll need the MC-DG100 - and it seems that this is MUCH harder to find.Just to note, I've seen the MC-DG100 in action and it's great! I can only image that the MC-DG200 performs just as well. It's just that the DiMage Xi will not fit into this case."
1439,1,Good: The book is good and very useful to beginner and new student. Pictures are clear and easy to recognize in the book.
1440,1,"A great book for beginners...: This book gave me a very good background in astrology as a beginner. Not only does it give all the details of calculating a person's birthchart, but it goes to explain the significance and meaning of each aspect of the different planets and signs in a person's birthchart.The only bad qualities I found in the book were a few repetions of the text in similar parts of each sign, and the fact that the maps the author gave ended in the early 80's, even though I bought the book in the late 90's..."
1441,1,"Astonishing!: I'm pretty picky about my SF, and I have to say this is the most exciting new SF I've read in years. A huge, overwhelming vision, an epic story, characters to die for. This is truly an impressive book, and I am dying for the next one. Please!"
1442,1,"Great characters, hard to put the book down...: This was a good book in many ways, the characters were extremely well developed, I felt like I got to know them personnally.. and the setting was great. I think the book should continue. I was only a bit disappointed by the overall ""story"" with so many great characters it seemed like we were being set up for something great... but i think the story itself could have been further developed. There has to be another novel... we were all left hanging a bit. I hope she does write more... I would say that she is one of the better sci fi writers i have read in a while, (reminds me a bit of Dan Simmons books, a bit like Dune books). I recommend the book!"
1443,1,"A fine SF tale, in the old Space Opera tradition.: While I agree with one reviewer that the plot does not quite live up to the drama and complexity of the characterization, this world and these people are so deftly realized that it was still a fun and compelling read. When so many books are forgettable, it's a joy to once again meet characters and situations which leave me with a desire to experience more of their adventures.----------And I agree with the other reviewers: It's a tragedy this book has no sequels! I actually bumped into the author years ago and she said she had no plans for any--was on to other things... Very sad! Years later, I'm still wishing!"
1444,1,"BABYFACE - A Witness: BABYFACE by Jeanne McDermott is a witness to the healing power of love. It is a true story of how people of all ages grow to meet unexpected challenges. Although in this case the challenges arise from the birth of a child with a rare cranialfacial disorder, anyone with the experience of having children and creating a new family constellation will identify with many of the issues that face Jeanne McDermott and her family.There is nothing superficial about BABYFACE and it reveals no easy answers. Instead, the reader shares a truly three-dimensional experience where the word ""miracle"" regains its stark significance and a ""mystical vision"" expands our world.BABYFACE is a book for anyone with a family, at either end of the generational see-saw, and it will not leave you untouched."
1445,1,"closure: This an absolutely wonderful book. The author is my niece and I have spent many visits with Natanial who is a remarkable and well adjusted child. I am the "" Aunt E.J. "" in this book and am now in my 70\'s so I have had a long time to deal with my ""handicap"". This book brings a lot of closure and insight into many parts of my life. I would recommend this exquisite book to all ages."
1446,1,"babyface - a story of love, compassion, humor, and happiness: Caught in shock of the birth of a child with unexpected physical problems, the author finds humor, love, compassion, philosphy, bonding with friends and family, insight into our common humanity - and above all, happiness and joy! I loved this story."
1447,1,Still Great Games: We actually purchased all of the titles individually when they were first published (we still don't have the Friends game). They are all very good games. My 6 year old son has learned to play Chess so well from this that he can beat his parents more than half the time. Legoland was so addictive that he and I played nothing else for about 2 weeks straight. I still find I like creating parks from scratch.My only complaint: Can't run Lego Creator under Windows XP. Lego Alpha Team's sound is dodgy under Windows XP. I wish Lego Media would provide a minor patch for these products.
1448,1,"A great and fun read.: I love this series of books. They are witty, sad and unbelievable, well almost. I enjoy this style of writing mixed with all kinds of scandalous politics, Kings, Queens and those commoners in between. What fun."
1449,1,"Really a fun read: Enjoyed this a lot.....Sex with Kings was good....this was even better....wow, really popped the top off of Princess Diana, but I still like her. Well written, really enjoyed the authors style of writing....seriously, if you like the inside scoop (even if it was 400 years ago)....BUY THIS!!!!!"
1450,1,Hawaiian shirt: I needed an Hawaiian shirt for a party - ordered this one - it's very colorful and came right away.
1451,1,"Good strings for a good price.: The First Act guitar strings is a good product for the money, I hate spending 15, 20 or even 25 buckson guitar strings when the sound quality isint that much different than 25$ strings and as a musiciani change my strings frequently so spending less is always smarter in my opinion unless your a die-hardfan of some other brand. For the price and sound quality First Act Acoustic/Electric guitar stringsis the best bang for your buck!"
1452,1,"It\'s Okay: I was excited to buy one of these puppies since i saw Die Hard 4, and after seeing this was only about ten dollars online, i went for it. It is just what you would expect from a keyboard of this type. It is flexible, it feels just a little strange (but totally easy to get used to) when typing, and can be cleaned easily.This is NOT a keyboard you would want to use to do some serious work in, instead its probably just a cool thing to show off to friends or the like. The only problem i found with the keyboard itself is that the picture online is misleading: the color of the keyboard is a dark see-through grey and not the dark black as shown in the picture. Also the color of the usb cable is black and not white as shown in the picture.I am not too fond of the old school enter key that looks like a ""return"" key from older keyboards, but that is a personal preference. If you want to have something cool that you would use occasionally, i would recommend this."
1453,1,"great: perfect for low usage compact space, plug-n-plays with xp would recomend for anyone without enough room for a full size keyboard all the time"
1454,1,"Great For Home Yoga: This Yoga instruction is the best I got so far and I love practicing it. Mark has done an excellent job with this. His instructions are perfect and he has a calming voice which is surely a plus. I'm sure it will make you feel great, sweaty and relaxed while toning out your body. I highly recommend this to everyone!"
1455,1,"best I've seen: I usually don't bother with reviews. But i had to post that this was the best yoga DVD I have ever seen. From the production value to Marc Lewis' instruction, this DVD is of the highest quality. In particular, Marc gives clear, complete explanations and instruction while keeping the energy up and positive. Truly a great find."
1456,1,Design Director: This product should fill the bill in an Interior/Universal Design project we are finishing. This will be modified to fit into the custom sized generous wall pockets for our wheel chair accessible shower room.
1457,1,"I love Jeremy Brett!: Okay, maybe I'm partial because of my deep and undying love for Jeremy Brett, but I love every video in this series. This one is a little skimpy on Brett-time, and it's not clear who some of the characters are. I think this comes from extending one of the shortest stories in the Canon into a two-hour movie. But if you want to see Holmes as a weepin', kissin' fool, this is the film for you. This is one of the only episodes where Holmes shows anything approaching deep emotion, and I love it just for that. And Jeremy Brett. (Yeah, I know he's dead. If I ever learn how to revive people...never mind.)"
1458,1,"A good one, not liked for some reason: There is nothing wrong with this one. It is much better than lots of them. For some reason lots of peple don't like it. Jeremy Brett is perfect in this one. Even of his illness he was perfect for therole. He acted fine even though he was ill. The actor who played Watson is even good! This film is good. There is nothing wrong with it!"
1459,1,"Does not break.: This is definitely a good cell phone.I have seen all those fancy cell phone with huge screen and photo capabilities, but what's the point? I only want to call people with my phone, and if it does that, I am happy, and this phone does it well and has a good price.I have also dropped this phone about 50 times since I got it 6 monthes ago and not a single thing has gone wrong for the phone as a result of my carelessness.I think this is a perfect phone for someone who wants to keep things simple"
1460,1,"I have not had a problem: I got this phone 2 weeks ago and I love it I have not had a problem with it and I get a great signal so I don't know what all the dissing is aboutITS A GREAT phone, and I charge it 1 a week!!!"
1461,1,Romantic music: His voice has never changed. When he sings you want to listen. He is so sexy. HE PUTS ME IN A ROMANTIC MOOD.
1462,1,"They work: Used in conjunction with a waterproof pad, these have worked great so far. Sharpie has made good stuff for years and this is no exception."
1463,1,"Awesome!!: This product met all my expectations and more!!! On time, Great product! As advertised! I highly recomend them. The BEST!!! Thank You for your incredible service and wonderful products!!"
1464,1,"is what you think it is: works fine, not much to say about them. they are what you think they are grease pencils, and should last me years"
1465,1,"Pigs at the Trough: Great book with lots of data that I was missing. I was already mad about the corporate greed. Now I'm even madder. It really is time to get the Constitution back in again. Arianna H did a great job and her humor makes for easy reading. I am about halfway through and I read some every night. It definitely is just what I wanted. You go, Arianna."
1466,1,"Huffington is at her usual best: Anyone that works in a corporate environment needs to be interested in the role multinational conrporations have on the global economy. The Corporation is a very inteersting entity, largely unchecked and left to its own conscience in many respects. Huffington explores this road."
1467,1,"Perfect title....: This is a perfect title for a book about unbridled greed in America. Yes, a lot of what corporate CEOs do is legal. So, what should we do about it as a society? Change the laws! Do these people even have a conscious?!?! Arianna makes a wonderful case for people standing up to say ""This is MY country and I am not taking this anymore."""
1468,1,the most amazing voice: u gotta hear this.....craig david has the msot amazing voice i've heard...he's really cool and HOT! he has a sexy voice .....i love all his songs and i wish for him the best...and keep it up craig...i lov ya Sweetie xoxo
1469,1,Fantastic product: The display system is fantastic. Easy to use and makes my job easier when on the phone with customers.
1470,1,"Futures of Days Past?: Being a fan of irony, I decided to read this novel now that it is the year 2000. Much like 1984 by George Orwell, many of the prophecies have fallen short of the mark. The Utopian strain of Bellamys vision is apparent but we have not nearly evolved that much. This book contains a lot of the naivity of the Socialist/Marxist intelligentsia of that era. Human nature, alas, is still much too flawed for that. But politics aside, this is an enjoyable, well written novel. Bellamy is obviously preaching but it does not detract from the story. Julian West is a sympathetic character in spite his aristocratic origin. It should also be stated that some of the predictions of the book like credit cards and malls have come to pass. It was stimulating and thought provoking to read this book in the year the story allegedly took place. It should remind us that we have come a long way but we still have a long way yet to go."
1471,1,"this book is amazing: Ok, i got this book as a gift. I had never heard of Bellamy and was worried that I would not like this book at all. But my apprehensions were soon soothed by the most interesting background story written by the editor Laura Bonds. The prologue she wrote about Bellamy sparked my interest and,honestly, I could not put the book down.The book is about a boy who goes to sleep and wakes up in the year 2000 (113 years later). The boy intellectually struggles with the facts of his old world and this new world utopia he has awoken in.The fictional utopia created by Bellamy birthed several utopia movements in America.I would recommend it to my friends."
1472,1,"Off and On Target (or Wal-mart): Edward Bellamy\'s vision of the year 2000 from the author\'s vantage of 1887 was wrong on the big things, but right on many smaller things. The Utopian communistic society never came to pass in America, but other things did. A previous reviewer mentioned the foreshadowing of e-commerce, but I would add cable broadcasting and the superstore, i.e. Wal-mart. Bellamy had a New Englander\'s hatred of waste and the book was his attempt to answer that very American question, ""How can we do this better?""All in all, a hopeful and challenging book. It makes you ponder conditions in the real year 2000 and the possibilities a hundred years hence. If you liked H.G. Wells\' ""A Time Machine"" or Thomas More\'s ""Utopia,"" then there\'s a good chance you\'d like this book."
1473,1,"Good, but a bit boring: I enjoyed reading ""Looking Backward."" It speaks much about the problems facing America near the turn of the century; the problems that affected almost everyone in America every day. The problems of greedy monopolists is the most evident, but also others. The book is not as much as a story as it is the author laying out his groundwork for a perfect society with a story sort of, but not really, built around it. There is sort of a romace, but almost the entire book is characters telling the protagonist what the future is like. I do find it funny though. Back in the 19th century, authors GREATLY underestimated the technological progress of mankind. Just decades later, it was the opposite- and authors were greatly overestimating it."
1474,1,"Classic Victorian fantasy: Written during the era of the worst excesses of the ""gilded age"" and some of America\'s worst early labor upheavals including the Great Strike of 1877 and Haymarket and just prior to the Pullman and Homestead strikes. Looking Backward is an expression of Bellamy\'s faith that the industrial age and industrial cities could be made to work for all, not just the few. The book, a top seller of its time, above all shows that our ancestors believed they could reach the future without perishing."
1475,1,Great product: I continue to rate the skin medica products very highly. Have found good results with problem skin and have experienced good competitive prices on Amazon.
1476,1,"Truly insane: Insane, cute, or just plan weird this is a great book that shows just how creative Michel's imagination is. The book shows illustrations he did many years ago but is as fresh as the work he does today. It's a great book in seeing the hindsight of what was to be in his artistic style. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys interesting character designs and just wants a good laugh, it will bring a smile to your face gauranteed."
1477,1,Book: The book seller was really prompt in his service. I thought I was getting a used book but I received a brand new book sealed in plastic. The book on residential energy is very through and I after I read it I plan to take retest for my BPI class with Everblue.
1478,1,great resource: Krigger explains energy use and conservation in a very simple way. Very informative resource that I foresee using for many years to come.
1479,1,physics phun: This book was a great read and support tool for the training I was taking. It starts out with physics concepts and moves smoothly through how they are applied to the buildings.smart layout and great reference sections make it a very useful tool.
1480,1,"Best of the best: Takara: Takara is another, in the VERY long list of exceptional bands that the one-and-only Jeff Scott Soto was involved with. I can\'t imagine how Jeff Scott Soto isn\'tmore widely recognized for his contributions of melodic rock music, but hey, sometimes the best things aren\'t even known.Takara released this greatest hits record in 2004; and it covered their three studio offerings of the 1990s. ""Eternity: The Best Of Takara"" is what greatest hits packages should be about. You get a whopping eighteen songs on this baby, including five from ""Eternal Faith,"" six from ""Taste Of Heaven,"" five from ""Blind In Paradise"" and two acoustic numbers as well. That\'s a lot of tracks for only covering three albums. My favorite songs are ""Spotlight,"" ""Fallen Angel,"" ""Two Hearts Together"" and ""Your Love.""Like I said, this is the way to go for a greatest hits offering. No way to go wrong with all the songs you get, and you may in turn want to track down the bands three studio offerings as well."
1481,1,"Solid: I saw these guys live on the Southern Ska Tour and bought this cd. I must say it is great and well worth buying. They have a great sound, and regardless to what others say, the lyrics are just as tight. Do yourself a favor, and go see them live."
1482,1,"Great book: I have always loved the story of ""The Headless Horseman"", so I was excited to read this book. After their mother dies, Aimee and Shane Lancaster move to the town of Sleepy Hollow with their father. Right when they arrive strange things start happening and a lot of creatures start appearing. Aimee and Shane along with their new friend Stasia must stop them all by first stopping the Headless Horseman. Overall it was a great book. It got boring at times, but not for long! Christopher Golden did a great job retelling the story of ""The Headless Horseman"" in a whole new way. I loved it and I can\'t wait to read the others!"
1483,1,"A Page-Turning Techno Thriller: This is a complex, well-developed thriller that builds to a nail-biting resolution. What if Castro had kept one of the missiles of October? What if it were a threat to the U.S. today? High tech investigation and FBI field agent effort blend in a frantic search to stop a nuclear event. This book's excellent core idea is developed and executed with intelligence and a deft attention to detail. Hopefully an e-edition of this novel will be coming soon."

1485,1,"Darling portacrib quilt set!: Absolutely darling quilt set for the portacrib. Fast, efficient delivery. Can't wait for my new granddaughter to try it out!"
1486,1,"Bela does it again!: Even though Bela\'s movies are ""before my time,"" I can\'t help but appreciate his roles in these low budget flicks of yesteryear. I love the premise of this movie and can see a modern variation on this theme of giant bats that ""sever the jugular"" of their victims.As a warning to all, do yourselves a favor and only buy the one which states that the movie was released by the Bela Lugosi Estate since this version uses the original film elements to present a nice, crisp picture. Bela Lugosi Jr. offers running commentary during the film as one of the Extras. He looks well preserved for his age if you get my drift.Anyway, a fun movie to watch. Don\'t take it too seriously. After all, it is a 1940s B-Grade horror movie. Just sit back and enjoy the show. And don\'t forget the popcorn for crying out loud!"
1487,1,"Bela Goes Batty!: Dr. Paul Carruthers (Bela Lugosi) is a scientist who invents new fragrances for a successful aftershave maker. His failure to invest in the company has left him without the millions he feels he deserves. Carruthers is a bitter man who has sworn revenge. How? Does he plan to sue for his fair share of the profits? Nah, the sinister doc creates a small army of giant, mutant, killer bats to exact his vengeance! These fuzzy monsters are attracted by a new aftershave lotion he's formulated in his secret laboratory. He gets his intended targets to splash some on their faces. One by one, the victims are attacked, their throats ripped out by soaring, shrieking, stuffed devil bats! Bela is priceless as always. This movie belongs in every horror collection..."
1488,1,"the best robin hood movie ever.: this is an old animated robin hood movie where the characters are animals.robin and marion are foxes.the taxman is a bear.so is john.the poor are mice.the kings a lion.you get the idea.robin robs from the rich and gives to the poor.the sheriff gets jacked and eventualy the folk hero has a duel with the king himself!the kids like it.i loved it when i was little.its a wholesome family film.its a true story so thats a plus.the kids will be educated and entertained.some of the scenes of the patheticly poor people a bit much for some kids.i guess the message is rob from the rich and give to the poor.but,wouldnt that just make the poor rich.soon hed be stealing from them and returning it to the king anyway."
1489,1,"Great Movie: This is a great show, and I was happy to find it on Amazon to give as a gift to someone who also loves this classic Disney Cartoon. One of the best!"
1490,1,"1973 Classic: Oo-de-lally,this movie is simply divine. To not have it as part of one\'s collection is a sin! It\'s funny,has got a little action, plus the chemistry between SLY Robin and FOXY Marian (pun intended) is divine. Oh and don\'t forget ""The Fony King of England."" AH ha..AH ha!!lol. That laugh is too much."
1491,1,Awsome!: This is a very good movie. My sister and i really enjoyed it. It is not the modern day war etc. movies it is a nice classic movie with a cool plot.It is awsome.
1492,1,So entertaining: I love Robin Hood. I remember watching it with my daughter when she was young and now my grandchildren will enjoy it as well. Great condition and prompt delivery
1493,1,"Classic Of All Time: This is my favorite movie of all time! Even though this movie doesn't compare to big hits such as Aladdin or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, this movie is hilarious. Every time I watch it I still get a kick out of a new scene or two. I love the character Prince John. Now I know he is a villian but, with him being jelious of his older brother and trying to live up with his mother's expectations he acts like a little two year old and he shows it well.What is also neat is that Disney has used animals and not cartoon people. The animals go with the characters and it is just so unbelieveable. I recommend this movie to all ages. Even adults will enjoy this awesome movie."
1494,1,"Classic Disney retelling of a favorite story!: This particular version of the ""Robin Hood"" tale may not stand up to historical scrutiny... but it sure is a wonderful version by any stretch of the imagination! I\'ve loved this one for many, many years and was excited when it was finally released on DVD. And not a moment too soon! My VHS version was looking rather tired.The animation is classic Disney, and makes a smooth visual transition from its predicessor, ""The Jungle Book."" Musical sequences are interwoven beautifully with the story, and the outstanding character development imbues each of the main ""leads"" with a larger than life persona.This new DVD version of the movie has remastered the audio and video aspects of the movie, breathing a renewed life into a venerable classic."
1495,1,"A great edition: I can't add anything about the movie itself. The only reason to buy these special editions is for the extra features. Behind the scenes stuff, how the movie came about, interviews with actors who did the voices, ect. If you care about those things, this is a great set. If you don't, there is no reason to upgrade."
1496,1,"Hey, it\'s a terrific comedy ...: Robin Hood often gets slammed by people who don\'t understand what it\'s supposed to be. No, Prince John isn\'t particularly menacing; yes, he\'s outwitted by Robin at every turn. This isn\'t meant to be a dramatic confrontation between good and evil ... it\'s a comedy. A ninety-minute collection of cartoon set-pieces, most of which are extremely well-done and hysterically funny (with the intentional exception of ""But Not in Nottingham,"" which shows the human impact of the villain\'s machinations in a way I wish more Disney films would).Enjoy it for what it is -- this was Disney\'s funniest feature until Aladdin. It won\'t thrill you, but it\'ll have you rolling in the aisles."
1497,1,Robin Hood The Disney Way: This is a very cute movie. It's one of the few animal/human hybrid like movies the Disney company does. I like this one because there's not just romance in it and that's what really makes it more fun.The music is all right. Not really the best score but I think the script and colors makes up for that.
1498,1,"Movie comes alive on DVD!: If you are a fan of this movie, you owe it to yourself to see it (or own) it on DVD. The color transfer is fantastic, the backgrounds are lush and detailed, as opposed to the washed out old VHS tape. The colors and line quality of the main characters are sharp and vibrant as well, I was hugely impressed. The movie looks on par with the newest animation releases, I can't say enough about the great colors. The background paintings look especially nice, with an almost computer-esque gradient fades on the sky. The sound is somewhat of a disapointment though, only Dolby Digital 1.0. I found it sounded best on 2-Channel stereo, even with a high end center channel. But all in all, if you haven't seen it on DVD, you really haven't seen it!"
1499,1,"Robin Hood stole my heart years ago...!!: I have loved this movie since I was a little girl and had to buy it for my son. He's only 6 months old so he's not watching it yet, but it's going to be the first movie that he sees. I hope he loves it as much as I have all these years. It will be tons of fun eating popcorn and watching the movie with him! This is Disney's best!!"
1500,0,not worth the price: Cheap little foldout card in very small print that is hard to read. The free stuff found in Hotels is better.
1501,0,This Cd is probably Do or Die's only lame cd: Do Or Die is my favorite rappers I own all of their cds out of all of them this one is the only dissappointment the left rap alot records which they made 5 other cds on and they were very very good and joind leagion records i dont know if its the record label or what but it aint hardcore like the other ones the only songs i liked were chain of command(track 3) and for the block (track 17) other then that the whole Cd is pretty soft
1502,0,"Cant Compare to Earlier Albums: The album has a couple good songs- higher with kanye west which has already been on the radio in chi town- but more importantly if you liked their earlier albums you will be let down. Songs like ""nobody\'s home"" just are not on this album....i like do or die- but dod did not do it for me..."
1503,0,"Boo: I reely like Do or Die, they are probably my favorate rap group, but Kanye West has ruined this cd. I have already heard all of these songs like 20 years ago, and I like the original versions. I always thought do or die had more creative songs then most rap groups, but this cd is not original at all."
1504,0,"Not good at all !: This is the 2nd worst Do or Die album out there today.I think DOD should do more single hits with Twista & Kanye West.D.O.D. just doesn\'t have what it takes to put together a great 15 track album.Terrible album ,I chucked it out my car window really fast.People look out for Twista\'s new album by Atlantic Records ""Day After""."
1505,0,"oh my god I can't believe what I'm hearing: Words can't describe how upset I am after listening to this album. As a huge ratm fan it hurts me that people let these amature attempts of copying one of the most influential bands of the decade. I wouldn't mind if they made a good job of it but this is ambarresses me so God only knows how Rage feel about it. For a start no-one can play the riffs as well as tom morello, so why try. Why not try and change a little or something. Zack's voice is completly unique and trying to mimic it is almost impossible. I donnot recommend this album to anyone who knows the quality of rage, and am very dissapionted with this outcome. What sort of record company lets these underbreeds into the studio. I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT A STAR BUT HAD NO CHOICE"
1506,0,horrible cover: Well RATM is an awesome band and are really hard to cover. I give them that. But my god if your going to cover them please make it better than this. this cd is a HUGE disapointment.
1507,0,"Are they serious?: I can understand a band wanting to pay tribute, but what the hell was the label thinking????? This band sounds like they should be on the soundtrack to an ARMY commercial. No direspect, but this IS disrespect to RATM. A curse on anyone who buys this album!!!!!!"
1508,0,"A bad tribute to one of the greatest bands in the world.: Rage Against the Machine are an awesome band. They are a very powerful band, with powerful lyrics and a powerful sound. So you would think they might get a good tribute, right? Nope, they don't. What they get is a horrible tribute by ameteurs(who the hell are the 'Renegadez of Funk?'). They are some rock band. But why don't they mix up different styles of music to Rage Against the Machine songs? Like some punk, rap... Anything that will be a little interesting that this garbage. Some of the songs on here are not even Rage Against the Machine songs. Yeah, they were on the 'Renegades' album, but those were only covers of songs from Rage Against the Machine's favorite artists and songs. Maybe if a LOT more effort was put into this it would be worth buying... or at least useful. Instead, its a worthless tribute that will be forgotten in time(even though its practically forgotten now...)."
1509,0,"Lost for words...: I am staggered. I have no idea how or why this album ever got published. It defies all common sense. Why would RATM ever let anyone sign off on such a pathetic collection of soul-less music? Maybe to sell more of the 'real' stuff?Please, avoid this album. Why the people performing on it had to waste their time when they could be learning how to perform is beyond me..."
1510,0,"the worst tribute i've heard for my favorite band: Please, dont waste your time or your money on this cd. The lead singer lacked the intensity zack brought to the band and all the anger felt forced by the singer of renegadez. I do realize Rage songs are hard to cover, but , please, if your going to cover them make sure your band is capable of covering the song(s)."
1511,0,laughable.: worst piece of crap rage collection ever created. some of the songs they didnt even write. bad. not worth a star. dont buy it.
1512,0,"A tribute worth ignoring: This CD is made by a band called the Renegadez of Funk. Obviously, they named themselves soley to cover Rage Against the Machine's songs. While the music was quite acceptional given the fact that it's just a total copy of Rage Against the Machine, the vocalist sorely needs to speak to a motivational speaker such as Zach De la Rocha. He manages to take all the energy out of every song."
1513,0,"1 STAR for having the GUTS to market this junk: What a disappointment?! This CD is an insult to RAGE itself. Tribute? Ha! To sum it all up, please don't go out and buy this cd, better yet avoid listening to it."
1514,0,why? just why?: please stop these foos from killing it in the name of Rage Against The Machine...please.
1515,0,"interesting: I just heard about this cd last night, and I was very interested in hearing the clips. Once I did, I realized how important it is to cover Rage and have a guitar player who can figure out the sounds and a singer that sounds like Zack. The singer on those clips had no energy and didn't sound like Zack at all. That ruined it for me because the music actually sounded really close to the real thing. I don't understand why they'd have a tribute cd and try to sound exactly like the band when we can just go buy the albums of the real band."
1516,0,"Thin: Let\'s start with the positives:- the book is easy to read and reasonably well written;- the basic facts of the story are covered;- the book starts the story way back before the problems emerged so that you get a feel for what the business was up to.But- it is very short book for such a complex subject- the ""unravelling"" - the investigations into ""what went wrong"" are (ironically) not well covered- there is almost no coverage of the Andersen issuesSo save your dollar, pound, euro or yen - don\'t waste it on this book."
1517,0,"Doesn't Add Much: Having read many newspaper and magazine accounts of the fall of Enron, including excellent coverage in The New York Times and BusinessWeek, this book really doesn't add much. It's a concise retelling of the events, so that's nice. But it imparts no greater understanding or context. Among the problems: The writing is bland. The book gives almost no explanation for Enron's rise before the calamitous fall. It never makes clear exactly why Enron had to go bankrupt. This account spends hardly any time on Arthur Andersen's role, even thought it led to that accounting firm's ruin. The authors also have an odd obsession with Michael Milken, even though he seems peripheral to the Enron story. If you've missed the news in the past seven months, this book can quickly give you the outline of the Enron saga. Otherwise, save your money."
1518,0,"What went wrong at Enron: The book was thrown together. The author wanted to be a first mover in the marketplace that analyzed what went wrong at Enron. However, the author neglected to mention in detail and explain how off balance sheet special purpose entities were Enron's demise. This is a waste of time and money to read."
1519,0,"what went wrong... with this book: ""What Went Wrong With Enron\' desrves some credit for trying to quickly explain the collapse of the company just six months after it declared bankruptcy. But the book does a poor job of explaining how Enron grew to be the world\'s biggest energy trader, also lacks in color on the main personalities such as Ken Lay and Andrew Fastow and on the corporate culture that allowed for accounting fraud."
1520,0,"Lacking substance: I suppose this book provides a decent overview of what happened at Enron (this could be accomplished in much less than the 150 large print small pages it takes the authors), but the complete lack of depth left me feeling a little like I might after reading the box score of a baseball game.I rather suspect the primary reason for the lack of depth in this book is a desire to get it in print as soon as possible. I do not recommend this book for anyone who really wants to understand what happened at Enron."
1521,0,"no advancement!: There were no ideas that were not developed by the 1960's in this book. There were a lot of stereotypical 'war stories' of stuttering. The old mantra of self-esteem, which is being proven scientifically false over and over, is trotted out and delved into at length. Additionally, a lot of work is spent on relaxation technigues, coupled with manipulating the way you think about things (called framing in the book). Basically the author encourages one to 'get over it'. There are some slick new acronyms such as PWS (the person who stutters!!!) but come on...no advancement.I'd encourage interested readers to check out the Valsalva techniques found in other books such as by William Parry. Also do a Google search - there are some interesting articles about research on the left vs right brain usage that are beneficial to be aware of and focus on."
1522,0,This is cheap: I bought this and was highly disappointed - all the notes practically sound the same - it's incredible small - more for a child who wants to make noise. Do not buy
1523,0,"The Aulos Sopranino is FAR better: The Yamaha 300 series recorders are fantastic instruments. (I adore my soprano, alto, tenor, and bass!) Unfortunately, the Yamaha sopranino does not live up to the pure sounds of the others. It sounds both husky and nasal. The Aulos sopranino, which is about the same price, is a far better option."
1524,0,"Good if you want free shipping: I only purchased this DVD because I needed an extra dollar on my order to take advantage of the free shipping. Since there is no description of the DVD, I thought I would provide one for others looking for that extra buck they need to spend for the free shipping.This DVD is eight episodes of the three stooges CARTOONS. Judging by the thin cardboard cover, the quality is very poor. Looks like someone sat there with an old camera, took a picture or two of some scenes that were playing on an old color TV, scanned them into a PC, and printed them on a box. I just tossed the DVD out, so I can't tell you if the quality is what I think it is. It's basically something you will see at a dollar store.If you are looking for some three stooges episodes, this aint them. If you need an extra dollar to take advantage of the free shipping, go for it. Who knows, maybe some kids would be interested in it."
1525,0,"0 for 2: Well, the first one I received lasted 10 minutes. Smooth return and exchange. Second one I received lasted 2 minutes.Both times it lost signal and went blank. No option to pick another station or anything. Totally blank.There are 6 good reviews for this, so I guess I just had bad luck, but I felt the need to review anyway.While it worked, the sound was great.I expect my electronics to work for longer than 12 minutes though."
1526,0,"Not a Good DVD for a beginner: I purchased this DVD upon advise from my physician that Yoga could help with chronic back pain. The title read ""Yoga DVD for Beginners, seniors...."" and that coupled with the price made it an attractive product for me. I must say that after I loaded it and began the routine, I quickly found that this was not for a beginner! The instructor does not start by first giving an overview of the upcoming routine - this made it very difficult to follow, especially when you are in an inverted position and must look up at the screen to determine the next move/position. I wrote this review as a precautionary statement to others looking for a beginners series - keep looking! I\'m sure a seasoned Yoga student will find this workout beneficial & refreshing!"
1527,0,"The maker of this video should be sued!: This DVD is most definitely NOT for seniors, people with arthritis and sciatica or beginners. I tried to keep up with the instructor on this DVD, and a month later I am still having severe back pain. I've been to 2 Urgent care clinics and now I have to follow up with my primary care doctor. I'm sure I'll have to have an MRI and may be referred to a back specialist. I have never been in so much pain in my life!"
1528,0,"not for beginners: i am not a yoga master but i've gone to enough classes to understand the basic techniques. i would not call this a beginners dvd. they go through some pretty tough poses! also i didn't really like that it moved through each pose only once. i prefer to go through sequences of poses at least a couple of times. and each pose isn't held that long either. if people are looking for affordable yoga videos i would recommend myyogaonline. you can download videos for a reasonable price or become a monthly member for only $10 a month and stream as many dvd's as you like. they have a ton of videos with different instructors, different venues, different types of yoga, etc. overall if i had my choice i would buy a different dvd for a beginning level"
1529,0,"What the....?: Let me begin by saying that I am a fan of Charles Band and his Full Moon productions (when, oh when, will we see those on DVD?). Having said that, I picked up ""The Possesed"" based on his name alone. Anyone who has seen any of the Full Moon movies knows that you are not getting A+ stuff here. They are campy, fairly low budget flicks shot for straight-to-video. Nevertheless, I enjoyed them quite a bit.This piece of film sludge has NOTHING in common (except the budget, perhaps) with Charles Band\'s earlier works. There is absolutely no redeeming qualities to this poorly worked trilogy. The acting can only aspire to be pure dreck. There aren\'t even any good sex scenes to make up for the rest. This is an hour and a half of your life that you will NEVER get back! Avoid it at all costs."
1530,0,"Klute Sountrack from Harkit Real or legalized Bootleg?: Well This release has been sought after and we are given a spruced up LP dub onto a CD format. Most of it sounds fine, but the paper quality of the booklet with typos throughout What is it with bootlegs do they not have someone smart enough to edit these notes? THe printed CD quality image is horrible as well as the back cover - Really tacky. I think the Score is awesome but this really is a poor delivery on Harkit Records behalf. You'd expect more form a company in Englaqnd most known for LP rips onto CDs selling them as if they are the best CDs ever. There should be laws against selling an CD release like this so poorly executed.If I have typos in my review please forgive me no one from Harkit Records was able to go voer these notes.JackDVD78@aol.com"
1531,0,Netgear FVL328 router: Very poor experience. The router worked well until the 30 day return period was over. I have been using three of them and they crash virtually every day. Don't even consider using it anywhere where reliability is critical.
1532,0,"...: 15 users, this unit continously crashes and very poor performance. I'm returning this unit as its not performing as advertised."
1533,0,"Consider Carefully: ""High Speed""? Don\'t think so. These units are easy to set up and install, and are feature-rich. They might work fine if you only have a few users (like under 10), but I experienced serious performance issues with only 25 users connected. They slow down seriously when you run a decent amount of traffic through them."
1534,0,Netgear let this one before they finished desiging the unit.: I purchased this high speed router for a dedicated satellite internet connection. The unit provides one SSL outbound connection which is almost useless. The unit will not autosense the modem connection speed either 10 or 100 Mbps. The manufactures solution is to put an ethernet hub between the router and the ethernet modem. (what kind of a fix is that) Not what I would consider top of the line from Netgear. I would not recommend or sell one of these to any of my other customers.
1535,0,"NetGear: unreliable, bad support & performance: I've owned a variety of NetGear units over the last five years, mostly stuff given to me, bought cheaply at sell-outs, and left over from dot-bomb company crashes.I keep using them because I have four of the same units I didn't pay for, and I only have three connections hooked to them. I gave up dealing w/their support years ago.Once or twice a year the unit and/or the power supply burns out, and I recycle the unit at a local company. When I run out of units or power supplies, I'll be done with NetGear and will avoid them completely in the future.The Linksys router I have sitting next to it is four years old and still running without any downtime."

If you are buying from this seller make sure to READ THE FINE PRINT before finalizing the purchase."
1537,0,"DVD will not play in American DVD player: The movie is fantastic but the DVD itself is foreign and therefore will not play in either of my standard DVD players or in a PS3. It plays only on my ibook G4, which is beyond irritating.

1538,0,Not a U.S. compatible DVD/Wrong Continent!: I received the Frankie and Johnny DVD. It is not compatible with any of my three (3) DVD players/blu-ray players. Looks like a European version --- distributed by Paramount U.K.Return policy is a joke --- what a rip-off.
1539,0,Frankie & Johnny DVD: The DVD arrived in good shape but had a region code for somewhere over seas when I complained to the people who sent it they wanted me to sent it back at my exspence. I'm thinking they robbed me once they wont get another chance.
1540,0,"DVD was not playable.: Apparently, different countries have different codes in a DVD player. I thought all DVDs were the same. I was so excited to get the movie, but so disappointed I could not play it. It would've cost the price of the movie just to ship it back, so I just had to throw it out. That was a waste of money."

1545,0,"A mixed review: I bought one of these in Feb. '08, still have it, it works and I like how it performs. But I must note it gets very little use. However with that in mind I bought a 2nd for our childrens' religious school in Nov. '09. I recently learned that it's not worked since some time during the last school year and it's a small school <15 students and they only meet once a week. Therefore I'd warn you off buying this. It shouldn't die when it's not even two yrs. old and has only been used 1x/wk. during the school yr. by <15 students in an 1 1/2 hr. class!"
1546,0,"Poor quality, but at least they are sending a replacement free of charge: Worked great for 1 day, but that was it. Unfortunately, I threw out all of the packaging after I saw it worked so did not have the packaging to return to Amazon. Fortunately, Amazon still allowed me to return using the packaging from the replacement product that they sent via next day air. Good customer service, bad product, but I guess all manufacturers may make a dud now and then. We'll see how the second one works. Would have been 1 star but for good customer service on the return."
1547,0,Poor Design: X-Acto did a very bad job in designing this product. If the plastic stem on the shavings catcher breaks off (it does very easily when removed) the sharpener won't function. This sharpener had to be replaced after about three months of use. Get the Panasonic KP-150. It's a much better investment.
1548,0,Chinese made: Item is not made in the USA as stated in the product description. It is cheaply made and is made in China.
1549,0,"bad: I found this sharpener sharpens lopsided too. I had an X-Acto battery operated sharpener which was a complete POS. Brand new batteries and it operates like the batteries are almost dead. Had two of them, both did the same thing.No more X-Acto, I've been punished enoughOur Local College has hundreds of the commercial grade Boston sharpeners that are pretty bad too."
1550,0,"Disappointing!: Before purchasing the X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener, I paid half the price for an electric sharpener from Wal-Mart that lasted over five years. This product has lasted a mere five months. Rarely used, it often sticks, overheats after only a few uses, and then ceases to work at all.I had hoped a sharpener of better quality would last longer, especially considering it isn't even used very often. It would seem I was mistaken."
1551,0,"Returned it: Agree with the previous reviewer. Office Depot is currently selling the made-in-china X-acto brand sharpener. Bought one and returned it after three pencils. Didn't seem to have much power, stalled the motor on the first pencil. Created nice sharp points though, just not always centered on the pencil. I'm looking for another sharpener."
1552,0,"Confusion over the model: REVISED 1/2/2008: I ordered the Hunt Boston 1800 electric sharpener from Shoplet and received the X-Acto XLR Electric Pencil Sharpener. In talking with Shoplet\'s Customer Service department the Amazon link is attached to the X-Acto product in Shoplet\'s inventory. X-Acto, as well as Hunt & Boston, are now Elmer\'s Products, Inc. brands. I tried to research on the web whether the Hunt Boston 1800 is still made; it is unclear. This maybe the only model currently available.Shoplet issued me a full refund of the product and let me keep it. We have are not heavy pencil users and have only sharpened 10+ pencils so far. But these are fine. The pencils have pin-sharp points. Occasionally with an unsharpened pencil the sharpener\'s ""auto-shutoff"" does not activate and I pull the pencil out to check if it is sharp; but other than that, the unit is working fine."
1553,0,Low Quality: Purchased this item in March 2012 and have used it lightly over the past 5 months. Found it to be cheaply made and very difficult to get the sharpener to function when pencil was inserted. Almost everytime I used it I had to manuever the pencil within the sharpener to get the sharpening motor to engage and sharpen the pencil. While this unit works it takes too much time to manipulate the pencil to engage the sharpener. Better off with an old school manual (non electric) sharpener rather than this one!
1554,0,"No Good: This pencil sharpener just arrived today and it doesn't work at all. Very disappointed. It is going back. I have had other Xacto sharpeners that have held up . As a classroom teacher, a durable pencil sharpener is a must."
1555,0,"Lasted less then a year, with light usage.: I was disappointed with this purchase - it lasted less than a year, with fairly light usage (twice a week). Even when it was working, it was not a great product."
1556,0,"Totally Disappointed: 1. Totally different finish color from the picture addressed. Actually, it looks cheap.2. Its finish quality is poor. Very rough and sharp plastic edge. I don't want my kid use it. It may hurt fingers.3. It has unstable vibration and noise. I feel very unstable, cheap and light..."
1557,0,"Terrible !!!: Terrible. A break lead while sharpening and chews down the whole pencil before creating a sharp point. Seems to be askew and at a slight angle. Also the angle it sharpens at is very acute, makes for a weird tip shape."
1558,0,Big Let Down: I bought this for my 3 kids. I read many of the sharpener reviews and decided on this one. We used it maybe three times and after that the machine will not turn off. We have to unplug it each time to get it to stop sharpening and then plug it back in to use it. How hard can it be to make a good pencil sharpener?
1559,0,"Trust the other reviews -- this does NOT sharpen evenly!: I returned this item immediately. Like other reviewers have indicated, this does not sharpen pencils evenly. It left a sliver of wood along one edge of the pencil that you have to peel off with your fingernails. I tried this sharpener with several different brands of pencils in the event that the pencil lead itself was off center. This was not the case. All pencils had the evil sliver.I cannot recommend this item."
1560,0,"Poor from get-go: Bought it for my son\'s 6th=grade class. Made a ""grinding"" noise from the beginning and then wouldn\'t turn off when the kids used it. While I\'m sure many of the kids were rough with it, after 1 week it was toast."
1561,0,"Watch out for product switching: I ordered the Hunt(R) Boston(R) 1800 Series Electric Pencil Sharpener, from Amazon.com and they in turn sent the order to Office Depot which sells those X-Acto By Boston 1800 Series Electric Sharpener, Black Sharpeners made in China that will not sharpen a pencil to save your life, the same ones they sell at Staples, which is why I tried to buy the Hunt(R) Boston(R) 1800 Series Electric Sharpener online. Now I have to send it back and try to get the good Boston pencil sharpener with the strong electric motor in it that will sharpen a pencil, stuff made in china is crap, boycott all products made in china."
1562,0,"Spend a little more and get quality instead: Purchased this to replace an old Panasonic Auto stop. Loved it initially, but with two kids sharpening pencils for school--not unreasonable, it lasted less than 6 months. The old Panasonic lasted 10 years. For the cost, I wish I has spent more and purchased something of better lasting quality.We sharpen 24 pencils each at the beginning of the year and colored pencils--sets of 12, then it's just as needed. This will last if rarely used."
1563,0,"Made in China: Contrary to the product description, this is made in China. Even so, I might have rated it higher if it worked well. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It sharpens pencils to one side. We used to have good pencil sharpeners in elementary school. Do these exist anymore?"
1564,0,Stopped working after 2 months of light use: It worked fine for 2 months of light usage and then just stopped working.Don't buy it. It is not reliable.
1565,0,"Does not Sharpen Evenly!: I thought this sharpener would be suitable for home use thinking my kids and myself would not be so hard on it as in a school environment. I didn't think I needed to spend $50 to get a decent electric pencil sharpener. No matter what type of pencil I try to sharpen, it always sharpens it mostly on one side, leaving the other side still encased in wood. Then, I have to pick off the wood on the unsharpened side. I also purchased an ipoint pencil sharpener and have the same problem. At work, we have a 20 year old Panasonic, and I wind up bringing pencils from home to sharpen them perfectly and then bring them home again. So, after spending the equivalent on TWO worthless electric sharpeners and many ruined pencils I'm going to try the Panasonic."
1566,0,"Broke after 4 months of very mild use: Unfortunately, this sharpener stopped working after 4 months of very mild use (essentially for homework of 2 elementary school age kids). It seems to overheat, but doesn't have an auto shut-off, so it finally stopped working altogether. We also weren't happy with how it sharpens the pencils, as they sometimes came out lopsided, and the sharpening tip is way too long (it really wastes pencils this way, which matters when you have nice colored pencils)."
1567,0,Poor Performance: This product sharpens pencils so sharp that they break..hence....the end result is catastrophic and requires purchasing more pencils and using manual pencil sharpeners as opposed to Electric ones. They need to go back to the drawing board for this model.
1568,0,"Didn't work at all. Returned it.: I guess I shouldn't have started at the bottom. I know electric sharpeners aren't cheap, but I just didn't want to spring for one of the more expensive ones. I put an un-sharpened pencil in the sharpener. Nothing happened. I took it out, put it in again. Applied a little more pressure this time and got a hum out of the motor, but no sharpening. I tried a pencil that had already been sharpened, but needed a finer point. More of a hum, but still no sound like anything was moving in there.If it doesn't work out of the box, I'm not even going to try another. Packed it back up, requested a refund and sent it back. I'll try another brand. Not even going with another X-acto, even though the next one up claims to be the model that used to be the Boston one I used at my office for years."
1569,0,"DOA: I bought and donated an X-acto Electric Pencil Sharpener for my daughter\'s 2nd grade class. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when my daughter brought it back because ""it doesn\'t do anything, Daddy."" A complete dud."
1570,0,"Sent back for refund: This particular sharpener runs hot, before completing a sharpening of one raw pencil. Once the motor cools, approx. 15-20 minutes, you can begin again. I sent this back for a refund. Perhaps this was a lemon?"
1571,0,"X-Acto is an inferior sharpener: I have been trying a number of battery powered sharpeners since my Panasonic pooped out (their latest ones make a wedge type point that dulls quickly and I've given them away.) The best I have found is the Derwent which not only handles different sized pencils, but has point sharpness adjustments and also a more tapered profile is available, which I like the best."
1572,0,Do not buy!: I bought this product in Nov.2011. It stopped working in Oct.2012. A poorly made product. A waste of money.This product should be discontinued.
1573,0,"Chinese Junk is not just a boat: I have now bought 3 sharpeners from china, one from staples, one from Derwent (THE PENCIL people in England) and one from good old Walmart, the U.S. open door to CHINAThey all have the same Crap gears in them mounted in a plastic and alloy (aluminum) base. I use lead, graphite, colored,water soluble & pastel. They will not hold a pencil straghtor sharpen all sides evenly and consistantly break the leads (Centre cores) and am reduced to sharpening with a hobby plane made for model airplanes with only an Xacto blade. BOY !!! Dont't ask me for a recommendation. FORGET IT!!!!!!X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener (1818)"
1574,0,Not the product it used to be: I keep thinking that in 2012 products should have improved after 25 years but the electric pencil sharpener along with so many other products had become a piece of junk instead of a better product. This doesn't want to start and then when it does it eats up the pencil.
1575,0,Sharpener just don't stop spinning.: Sharpener just don't stop spinning as opposed to start the motor only when pencil is inserted. I'm returning this product.
1576,0,"Not good!: Having read the other reviews, I should have known better, but I was attracted to the clean looking design and figured ""What could possibly go wrong with such a simple item?"" Well, I was wrong, the darn thing didn\'t even turn. Just sat there and hummed when I tried to sharpen a pencil. Absolutely DOA! I guess they don\'t have a quality assurance program. I\'ll be going back to using my pocket knife for sharpening pencils. One star is a very generous rating!"
1577,0,2 months of use at home just for homework and it stopped working!: My husband purchased this sharpener in Dec 2011 and two month later is has completely stopped working! We only use it to sharpen pencils to do homework for 2 kids. Save your money and don't buy this!! You're better off with a disposable sharpener it will probably last longer and will be a whole lot cheaper!
1578,0,"Great while it lasted...which wasn't long: Purchased this pencil sharpener in July, in preparation for start of school. Two kids using it to sharpen pencils for homework, sharpened well and quickly. However, it died after less than two months of use. Won't be replacing it with this same model."
1579,0,"2nd One I received: I've ordered a lot from Amazon and always read the reviews but never write any, until now! .... I ordered this pencil sharpener two times and both didn't work upon arrival! All you heard was the sound of a motor trying to turn. It sounded like it was locked!I figured ok, the first once I was unlucky and that's life. But to receive another one that doesn't work, is a problem! I can't be the only one to be unlucky. I can't tell you how frustrating it is when you order an item (PRIME) overnight and it doesn't work. I could of easily gone to Staples etc... but that defeats the purpose of buying from Amazon which is suppose to be quick and easy at the comfort of your pc! So, if you are like me and attracted to all the 4-5 star ratings and best of all the decent price, that your luck at ordering this. Perhaps it was my lucky number twice!"
1580,0,IT doesn't even work: I opened the box and plugged it in. I put a pencil in the opening. All it does is making a buzzing sound. How bad it is to receive a defective one. It looks like this has been returned before.
1581,0,What a waste of time....: This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I take that back. It definitely is the worst movie I've ever seen. The good news is that I didn't pay a cent to see it. The whole movie was comprised of really bad acting. Rob Lowe must be hurting for money. The plot was beyond ridiculous. I feel sorry for anyone who was in this movie or had anything to do with it. It really stunk up the place.
1582,0,"Rob Lowe is no Harrison Ford and this is no Fugitive: If you want to rent this video, don't waste your money. The story is so similar to the Fugitive that you might as well get that one instead. Lowe plays a teacher who is in prison on a vehicular homicide charge who begins to suspect a conspiracy to kill off prisoners. After a bus accident, he escapes and tries to figure out how to save his life with corrupt guards chasing after him. I only wanted to see it because it was filmed in Cleveland and it was weird seeing familiar streets on my TV. I have never been a big Rob Lowe fan-I always thought of him as a slick pretty boy-but he actually ACTED in this movie. James Coburn, one of my favorite actors, was wasted in his role of a victims advocate. All in all, the dialogue was terrible, the direction choppy and the storyline has been done to death."
1583,0,"This movie made me mad!!!: ...I am a huge movie fan and I will always give a movie a chance, but this movie never even had a chance!!! ...There are so many parts of this movie that were not well thought out at all ...I dare you to see this movie!!!..."
1584,0,This book depressed me to the point of near suicide!: This is a horrible book! It should be read to inmates who get life imprisonment.
1585,0,"wha happen'?!: What on earth has happened to this band? I was such a fan untilI was able to really listen to this, which only made it more difficult to write this. Karma in contrast, was such a heart feltwork of art, but this album seemed to be driven by something elselike record execs or some outside force. songs seemed to only climb half way up before they got annoying. Hopefully the canstep back down and try again!"
1586,0,"Nothing New.: Kamelot I don't think is a real consistant band. Yes they have a few good songs. But only a few. The lyrics are boring and have no good stories or twist to them and the music is nothing special. Nothing new here on this CD. There isn't a good song that you would listen to over and over again. There is just something missing. If I were you I wouldn't spend your money on this Cd. Save it for a better album other than this. You are not missing much, trust me. If I could I would rate this CD a zero."
1587,0,I ROBOT DVD: WELL I MADE THE MISTAKE OF VIEWING THE MOVIE AS SOON AS I PURCHASED IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING GOOD. HAS PAUSES. NEXT TIME I WILL CHECK MY DVD'S IN CASE I NEED TO RETURN.
1588,0,awesome movie no real 3d: one of the worst 3d acquisitions in my library. already had this on dvd. movie was originally releases in imax 3d but this conversion stinks. don';t waste your money for it if wanted too add to your 3d library.don't take this the wrong way. i love the movie but 3d is a waste. i own other 3d movies (almost every title in blu ray 3d). and this one and darkest hour are the worst.
1589,0,"BAD DVD TREATMENTS FOR GOOD FILMS SUCK: I skipped I ROBOT in the theaters but I had a feeling it would be good enough to buy on dvd and worth the short wait. Well I waited for nothing because there are very little special features and i have enough bare bones dvd's such as the paramount made friday the 13th films. I decided to just download I robot off of bit torrent and found it to be a good movie that deserved the two disk package like spiderman 2 and collateral got. Being a huge will smith fan, i feel really let down that the film company schemes to release multiple editions of the dvd. stop being greedy!"
1590,0,"Nonsense!: This movie could have been more than it was. The evolution of robots into laborers appears to be within the grasp of modern technology, and robots beginning to take control of the humans who made them is already here . . like in space travel or microsurgery where people are unable to take manual control of the process . . . This concept goes back to RUR, the Czech play of decades ago, but, in any case, this version dissolved into a juvenile shoot-em-up. Instead of a thoughtful presentation of robots and their potential dangerous side effects, an examination of the advantages and disadvantages of these mechanical workers, it becomes a trivialized and stereotypical piece of nonsense, with the nasty corporate leader, the pretty but skeptical female scientist, the crusty and unbelieving police captain, and the hero, who survives in spite of himself."
1591,0,"Poor 3D: I had the original I robot and bought the new 3d version with some great expectation. The 3d is very poor, cannot tell the diff between it and the 2d version. Poor."
1592,0,"LOW GRADE conversion: 5 stars goes to JVC for working on a faster way to convert 2d to 3D on the fly.ZERO stars for fox inc for changing the movie from its ORIGINAL aspect ratio.in most scenes the background was not converted to save time, other scenes...about 25% ish were ok, the rest just SUCKED.over all the people that are calming this to be the best conversion ever are obviously employees of fox inc just trying to promote it. and they are just a bunch of LAIRS!"
1593,0,"this is the movie i may watch when i am bored to death.: I only remember the robots face after the movie. I am sure you will too. but that's all it's about. heck, I dont have much to say besides that.this movie is waste of time."
1594,0,"I, do not recommend.: I wanted to see this for a while and I thought it was a letdown. It held my interest for only a few seconds (which I think it's obvious which scene that was, I wasn't expecting that) There are special effects, but those could be created with a computer for any movie at any time. I like Will Smith, but this just doesn't do it for me. If sci-fi is what you crave, I would say look elsewhere. I've seen the comparisons to Blade Runner, which don't hold up to me because at least I can say I enjoyed that movie."
1595,0,"Wher are all the extras?: The Region 4 release in Australia has TWO discs with lots of behind-the-scenes and deleted scenes etc, it also has not one but three commentaries! I would normally purchase the Region 1 version from Amazon in NTSC because it is running at the correct speed of 24fps, but with all the extras available here in Sydney, Ive decided to get the PAL version at 25fps. Perhaps they will announce a special addition after you have already brought the U.S. version!!!! The same thing happened with the Australian 2-disc of The Day After Tomorrow - it has a separate disc with a lot more special features. Has the studio tried to fit everything on one disc and therefore removed alot of the special features? Also, because these Australian versions have only the movie on one disc, there is far less compression."
1596,0,"I, Boring: I\'ve seen this movie three times, and still can\'t force myself to like it. Frankly, it\'s boring. Will Smith looks bored, so does Bridget Moynahan (Sylvia Calvin) and Chi McBride. The ""funny"" one-liners are boring, too. The only person smiling in this production seems to be the robot, Sonny. And he\'s mostly animated! The movie is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, when the robots come alive and try to take over the world (what else?). But not by much. Even during the finale, Smith and Moynahan look bored and boring! ""I, Robot"" ends with a cliff-hanger, implying that another revolution is in the air, this time led by the nice guy Sonny. But since there\'s no sequel, we\'re ultimately left with nothing at all...Two stars."
1597,0,"Tired, Old formula: The only reason to watch this movie is the spectacular CGI. The combining of real actors (if you can call Will Smith a real actor) with CG looks terrific. But the plot is SERIOUSLY lacking...There are so many plot holes in this flick, I don\'t know where to begin. Was there any doubt after 10 minutes who the real culprit was? Once again, Hollywood\'s disdain for the ""evil corporation"" rings loud.During the big robot attack on Smith in his car, does anybody really believe that there isn\'t another car on the road? In L.A.?? LOL!It just goes on and on. What a terrible, mindless flick."
1598,0,"The 3 Laws of making over-hyped Hollywood garbage: 1. Use a storyline that has been done to death. Machines taking over mankind. Gee where have we heard this before?2. Over-dependence on CGI3. Will Smith. This guy is the same character in every movie, a smart arsed be-atch who needs an attitude adjustment. What a punk."
1599,0,"3 words: WILL SMITH NUDE: The movie starts off with our ""lovable"" action hero Will Smith waking up from bed completley nude. We can tell right off the bat that this is a typical Will Smith ego film fest. The story is good enough, but the fact that WIll Smith is just a "" "" bag, (you fill in the blank) makes this movie unwatchable. A good movie about Man vs Machine is the anime ""Ghost in the Shell"" or Blade Runner. I-Robot done in another way with another lead actor would have propelled it further."
1600,0,"Not a film for Asimov fans: Ugh.Asimov fans will cringe at this crude adaptation of his works. I found it to be bland, action-packed tripe, which failed to underlie the basic principles of Asimov story-telling; cerebral, mystery, detective - all of these styles are to be found in his books. Alas, not in this film.For someone who has never read an Asimov book, then this film as a complete standalone is mildly sufficient, that is if you like your action films set to a prediciatble formula; good cool guy, love interest, simmering tension building up to a grand finale. You get that here.Myself, I prefer something a little more thought-provoking.Like one of Issac Asimov's books, for instance."
1601,0,"thisdarkplace*blogspot*com: Hey, Will Smith, what the hell did Asimov ever do to you? This movie takes a science fiction classic and rapes it with bad acting and horrid dialog. I honestly don\'t understand why they bothered to call this ""I, Robot"" - it has NOTHING in common with the book except a couple of character names. This is a bad action movie and a slap in the face to Asimov\'s ground breaking work. I have no problem with crappy movies aimed at teenagers and other people who need lots of flashing lights and explosions to hold there attention but this movie is bad enough to turn people away from the book (read the book - seeing the movie won\'t even spoil the ending for you i promise)."
1602,0,"Beware the words 'Based on....': What did I not like about this movie? Pretty much most of it, I have to be honest. Why oh why is the future always depicted as being like Times Square at 5pm on a Friday? There are always hundreds of people in the background walking in about 50 different directions. Nonsense.Will Smith Fresh Prince'd his way through the movie, weaving his Audi and/ or his motorbike through some of the larger gaps in the plot (who has their house demolished once they die? What the heck was that all about other than an excuse for Smith to escape/ defeat - once again - the robots). You hate robots for saving you? You sleep with a large, presumably loaded gun in your hands? You are a maverick cop? Come on, guys, this is awful. Straight out of the 'Will this do?' school of filmmaking.Based on a series of short stories? I think not.An awful movie that I'm sure will have plenty of 5 star *awesome* reviews from people who check their brains in alongside their coats at movie theaters."
1603,0,"White Robots vs. Will Smith!!!: Will Smith was recently in the news saying that AIDS had been created by White people to kill Blacks. I guess this movie must be his revenge for that.It has little to do with Asimov\'s classic story. We get the usual cop on the edge who follows his hunches instead of the rules -- GIANT CLICHE!!! -- and then we get these White robots who want to wipe out Will Smith (a sure sign of artificial intelligence as the guys is such a nauseating, smug [supply own expletive]).After this it just descends into action-special-effects Hell as any interest or storyline is squeezed out by Smith leaping around, probably supported by wires, as an army of CGI geeks try to keep up with overambitious and cartoonish special effects -- Crash! Blast! Kaboom! ...Yawn!Nevermind the robots; Hollywood actors, directors, and producers should be programmed with ""the 3 laws of moviemaking"" - characters, story, and meaning. This pointless production breaks all three -- bad robot!"
1604,0,"Ehh Cough Bleh Uhh Snn Ugh NO!: A great story to only be completely barried by unwatchable action. Climax action scene? No just fighting the robots which were boring to watch after a few seconds. Great cast, great plot, great title sorta. Just the action was not interesting making this movie the worst summer movie I have seen in a long time."
1605,0,"This review is for the 3D Version - HORRIBLE - Don\'t waste your time!...: I\'ve proudly collected most all 3D Blurays available in the US since the beginning. I must say that I ROBOT is the worst 3D conversion I\'ve ever experienced. I actually sold it on ebay for $9. It looked like a pop-out book - simply unsatisfactory. FOX/SONY has boasted about their new techniquest to convert 2D Classics to 3D classics. Note to Fox/Sony: PLEASE DON""T RUIN ANY FURTHER CLASSICS IN YOUR CATALOG WITH THIS QUALITY CONVERSION. I was so Dissappointed - a Great Movie in a horrible 3D presentation.Sony/Fox should take some pointers from Pixar or James Cameron for the future 2D- 3D conversion. You thought Last Airbender 3D was bad - experience I-ROBOT and it makes the Airbender look like a classic. Shame on you Fox/Sony - Give us better quality 3D Conversions and we\'ll buy them."
1606,0,"Really, Really disappointed in this as a 3D Movie: When I ordered this with the other 3d movies, I thought that it would be the Best One. I ordered it because I loved the regular Blu Ray version, so much. Sadly it does not have that much 3D to it. I thought with all the top action scenes, it would have lots of 3D, jumping out at you. This version of 3D is mediocre at best. If, it had been more than $19.95, I would be returning it. As, this is a one on a scale of 10."
1607,0,Don't waste your money!: Very disappointing! There is hardly any 3d effects in this movie.I don't know how they can call it 3 d.
1608,0,Irobot 3d: The 3d effects were not as expected. Movie wasn't made in 3d likely reason. Not a bad movie in general.
1609,0,"Blah movie: If you're interested in wasting two hours of your day with the Fresh Prince of Bell Aire, go for it. If you're interested in a scene devoted to seeing his hinie, go for it. If your interested in action, gunplay, realism, intelligent picture flow- then don't go for this one.It's absolutely dismal. It's not worth anymore of my time describing what the previews lead you to believe to be a cool sci-fi flick, which turns out to be nothing more than HYPE."
1610,0,"Don't waste your money: The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing elseThe explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculousThe art work of the robots was goodWill Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon.I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters. The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity. None of this appeared in the movie."
1611,0,"I, Robot - Blockbuster Action Film??: If you never read Asimov, then you will enjoy this film. Stuff blows up real good, Will Smith wisecracks and shoots stuff and the co-star adds to the hoochie factor.But if you read the book, well the phrase ""Asimov spinning in his grave"" comes to mind. The idiot screenwriters, treating the 3 Laws of Robotics as a suggestion, created a script full of ""Crazy Killer Robots"". This was something Asimov often poked at in his writings. The Outer Limits episode called ""I, Robot"" is more faithful than this mess.What\'s worse, Alex Proyas, the director of the great ""Dark City"" directed this affront to good sci-fi.And I thought ""Minority Report"" was as bad as it could get..."
1612,0,"Oh Will Smith, how do we hate thee?......: If you thought David Lynch's Dune was a travesty, have a look at this mess!Its got a dude, its got guns and its got stuff exploding!Avoid this trash, and read the thoughtful and non-violent book.Susan Calvin rules!"
1613,0,"not that bad , but not even close to the book: The film is not actually that bad , but instead of been call I Robot it should be call hardwire (scrpt's original name).For anyone that wants to see an Hollywod action movie itsok but if you want to see a film based on Asimov book ,don't see it because it's totally based on other story not even closed onwhat asimov wanted to tell about it in his books."
1614,0,Predictable Smith performance like an anchor to movie quality.: Could have been a very good movie were it not for Will Smith's predictable performance. Come to think of it so was Independence Day. I find myself bored to tears watching this guy and his predictable hatred for robots or love interest stuff. Hard to sit through it waiting for the good stuff. His stuff is strictly canned.I can't imagine any director with brains wanting him for a lead so one can make an educated guess that there was a deal involved. That gives the actor power to alter his part. In Smith's case my guess is his performance kept a constant eye on what the characters actions would mean to Will Smith's career and not what it would mean to the movie. In fact that seems always to be the case.The hatred of robots bit is so contrived its brain numbing.Note who takes up 90% of the cover.
1615,0,Oops: I have the movie in full screen. I wanted a wide screen version to play on my computer lcd monitor.Oops!! it quit playing about halfway through.Tested on a stand alone DVD player same thing.Dispointed...
1616,0,"I, Bored: What a boring movie. There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours, but not by much. Every scene begins with a door sliding open to reveal Will Smith (of whom, I can't say I'm a fan) and/or his dialogue partner (I don't dare call much of what anyone does in this 'acting'). I've never seen Bridget Moynahan in anything else, and I hope the trend continues--what a bland, monotonous person.The commentary is likewise boring, and repetitive, with pretty much nothing interesting to offer... much like the movie.The only bright point would be Alan Tudyk's performance as Sonny the robot. Capable actors James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, and Chi McBride are all pretty much wasted in bland background roles, in favor of Will Smith's wise-cracking good cop with a troubled past cliche--I mean, 'character'. At least they didn't find a way to shoehorn one of his songs into the movie. Watch it only if you must."
1617,0,"I, Robot: Very good movie, but the language was awful. Why do they have to ruin good movies with foul language and taking God's name in vain. We've always liked Will Smith. To bad they ruined the movie."

Enough said.But, saying that I haven\'t explained yet.He has ears that are on the same scale to Tom Cruise\'s nose, and my pal AJ""Jizzy B"" \'s enormous girth. I said to AJ ""Dude! Sweet! Dude! I wonder if we can get satellite T.V. for free if we splice a wire into those things?"" He reckoned we could, so we did, but the wire was really short, so that\'s why he looks so angry on the cover of the DVD, cos he\'s dragging the wall of my house round with him, but he can\'t figure out what\'s going on ; he\'s like: ""Dude, why\'s that wall following me around? That must have been one bad trip.""So the film sucks as it cost me a wall of a house, which promptly fell down, and also you can\'t see half the cast cos of Smith\'s ears, but it got one star as I got free satellite T.V.!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!"

The plot is ridiculous, never really being established, and it goes down from there. With a little effort, it could have been a comedy instead of just being silly."
1622,0,"Overhyped: This movie was a disappointment. If you aren't a science-fiction fan (and maybe if you are) you don't want to see I, ROBOT. It is one of those movies that is slow to get the least bit interesting and truly escalates at the conclusion of the movie. While Isaac Asimov was a great science-fiction writer, I, Robot in its movie version just doesn't cut it. Not even Will Smith can lighten this bland movie, with the exception of the ending. It just lacks in being a truly exciting movie. It seems like for a while it is a mix of drama and science fiction, and then here comes comedy relief from Will Smith. It is way overhyped and could've definitely been better. 2 stars."
1623,0,"Uggghhh...It hurts so much: Uggghhhh, that is the noise Isaac Asimov is making as he roles over in his grave. This movie tried to be more than what it was and in the process completely destroyed what Asimov had written. This movie is just a bunch of special effects and little wise cracks from Smith, who is just so funny. For what the movie was, it wasn\'t that bad, but the director should of left it had that, not try to make it seem like anything more. HTe concept of robots showing emotion and man vs machine,it has been done before, and much better (See ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: a Space Odyessy""). The whole concept has just been beaten to death and instead of bringing something new to the table and breathing life back into the concept, ""I,Robot"" lays it to rest, and then steps on and smashs it some more. For a mindless summer action movie, it is above average, but it tried to be something more hten that, nad it fell flat on its face."
1624,0,"Buyer beware!: A rip-off from Fox. First, all should know that the 3D version of the film has been CROPPED! The widescreen film therefore loses picture information...which is reprehensible considering that this is a visual-effects film. The 3D conversion is just ""meh"" as well. While I\'d give the film at least 3 stars, the hatchet job done to the movie by Fox makes it a must to avoid."
1625,0,"I, Will Smith: Nice Transfer, nice Audio, nice F/X, bad Script. A missed chance. Yes Will, you have been working out. With all that product placement I wonder if somebody put any money. No, it is far from Asimov. The good robot movie is still to be done. Spielberg's AI was a better try. The Day The Earth Stood Still has still the best robot so far (1951). It must not be easy."
1626,0,"great movie BAD DVD: The film it\'s self it great. The story is interesting. The effects are great, no shock there. The DVD only has 2 special features A ""making of"" and commentary. Everything else on the DVD is a bunch of previews. I have never felt the need to write a review of a DVD before but I felt I had to for this one because the DVD is just about the worst one I purchased. If you only care about the film buy it. If you are like me and special features are important don\'t waste you money. I also worry that the might be makeing a special or collectors edition."
1627,0,"Feel good hit of the summer?: In iRobot, Will Smith reprises his role as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air; only this time, the Fresh Prince is in the future! The movie starts out with the government hiring Will to teach the increasingly disgruntled unemployed worker robots how to rap and breakdance. It works and Will soon enrolls his electronic proteges in a rap and breakdance competition where they have to face off against Boogaloo Shrimp and his evil robot pal 23465477. Will's robots win and they sign a deal with Arista. The end. This movie sucks."
1628,0,"Hollywood doo doo: Just another overblown, overspecial effected, hollywood mess with very little thought to good plot or dialogue. And that actress is not attractive enough for a movie with this budget. And Will Smith needs to spend less time in the weight room and more time in an acting class. And all this old fashioned Sci-Fi just doesn't make good movies today. (see war of worlds)"
1629,0,"I, Suck: The movie bears no relation to the book, they probably just use the title for npublicity. As for this review:WHY ARE YOU COMPARING THIS MOVIE TO THE BOOK!? If you don't want to watch the movie, thats fine, so go into the corner and read your stupid book, but understand THIS IS A MOVIE NOT A BOOK...Did anybody ever say it was SUPPOSED TO BE based on the book?Um, yes... when it had the title, charecters, and theme of the book. Idiot."
1630,0,"I, Bored: A big screen video game. No characterization. Effects that are obviously computer generated. Such effects are inversely proportional to tension and anticipation. What a waste."
1631,0,Go home Smith: This is a terrible missues of one of Asimovs greatest novels. The relevance to the novel is only marginal.Will Smith is (as usual) doing a terrible job at being an action hero. He should have stayed with the sit-coms.
1632,0,"wow. this is a boring movie....: a friend loaned this to me over the weekend and i watched it on my laptop while enroute from LAX to JFK. after the first 30 minutes, i had the urge to quit and do something else as this is really a boring movie. the plot is predictabile, the same machine vs. men, humanity and love to all, hug the tree kind of deal. as i already 'wasted' over half an hour on this movie, i decided to stay put and finish the movie... only to find out that the boredom continued. even worse, this movie has no humor, takes itself too seriously as if the director has something to preach..... come to think of it, one star is too much but then, this is the lowest rating Amazon has for us. can we have negative 5 stars in the future?"
1633,0,"Horrible injustice to Asimov: This movie is terrible.Its just another formulaic piece of hollywood crap. Its a good thing Asimov is dead because he would have died after seeing this horrible movie supposedly based on his novel. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and I only gave it one star because you cant give zero stars. The writers,directors,producers,and actors in this movie should be ashamed!!!"
1634,0,"How about ""Oops, Robot"", instead?: Let me put it plainly: this movie gave as much of a hard time as Swordfish and A.I. combined, two of my least favorite movies in recent times. It feels like a waste of a good story and some great acting (Will Smith\'s) on a poor screenplay where the effects are (sometimes) the only interesting thing in the movie (the reason I don\'t give it 1 star only). Never mind the product placement which becomes fairly annoying after a few minutes... The movie goes into unbelievable mode far too quick, plus it has a tough time retaining your attention.For the record, I am not an outright critic of SciFi. I am a fan of the genre, but movies such as Bladerunner and more recently, Minority Report, really do it justice. And I LOVED Alex Proyas\' work with ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"", but ""I, Robot"" instead felt more like ""Oops, Robot"". Do yourself a favor and skip it altogether."
1635,0,"Disappointed...: Wow... I was expecting much more than this. The story is weak and has little foundation: It's makes things overly complex just to take up time, and the whole three laws thing was just plain stupid. The movie is all Will Smith frowning and being an idiot! I was expecting exciting combat sequences, with murderous robots in an out of control society. Instead, all i saw was an over-complexified paranoia fest, with pidly little robots scenes with, and then it went right back to will smith! The only really redeemable thing about this movie that stopped me from giving it 1 stars was the fact that the visuals were so darn cool! Apart from that though, there really isn't any depth or quality to this one. With great sci-fi movies out there like the matrix series and others, I don't know how I could recommend this to anyone."
1636,0,"Runs large, fairly slow to ship: This shirt runs large. The color is not the same as what is depicted in the image here (look beige in the picture, but has a greenish cast in reality), otherwise the quality is alright.Also, having been spoiled by Amazon and Costco, more than a week (9 days), for an item to arrive seems a long wait."
1637,0,"Good Ideas, Empty Writing: This had all the elements that had me excited: magic as a disease, a gateway to two modern cities, and cool non-white characters. An aboriginal heroine! Please let it be good!Then I read the book. It's not difficult to get into, as the writing's smooth enough (rather too simple) but there's not much of it, as if you've added only one spoon of the chocolate mix when you need to add five to have something delicious. Events, scenes, plot, were all stretched out, probably to fit three books instead of one. And that's where it got boring, and rather weak. Not a dense, beautiful world that's brimming over with fantasy.Rather than magic, or the premise (which is exciting at first, then you wonder WHY does it take the character 250 pages to find out what the reader picked up at page 20), the book seemed more interested in fooling around with the minor differences between American and Australian English."
1638,0,"Might help if you have read Dufresne's previous books before: The book started out interestingly enough, informing the readers about the last surviving member of a New Orleanian clan, before continuing to the meat of the story, which is an upcoming family wedding. The author explores the thoughts and experiences of many characters, which can be confusing. The book even has an supplemental information section at the end of the book that contains materials that might aid in the understanding of what's going on.When reading the book, I got the sense that if I had read Dufresne's previous work about the same clan of characters, that I would've followed the story better. It's not too bad a book if there's nothing else to read."
1639,0,Deep in the Shade of Paradise: It was a very convivuled book and difficult to get into. The people's names were difficult to keep track of and the wanderings of the author were distracting.
1640,0,"Highly Disappointed: I should have read the reviews before orderin this book. Yes, the historywas interesting and I learned alot. The problem was that the list of colourplates were missing, the list of black and white illustrations were missing,the illustrations in text (quilting designs) were missing. The reason Iordered this book was to learn how to make the quilting designs. If I hadknown these were missing I would have gone to a regular bookstore to order it."
1641,0,"Don't bother with the Kindle sample: The kindle sample is totally useless. Based on other reviews I wanted to find out if there were any color plates in the kindle edition. All you get is one page, the table of contents, with links that ALL go to the same message offering to sell the book."
1642,0,"Beware the claim, ""High Quality Paperback"": Filiquarian Publishing is deceptively marketing a $9.99 reprint of Webster\'s classic quilt history book. It is a cheesy print-on-demand text-only version, with none of the original color and black-and-white illustrations. It is certainly not a ""high quality"" paperback. How can a quilt book be ""high quality"" without a single illustration!"
1643,0,"Uninspired wankery from a great bassist: As far as the music on this cd is concerned, the other reviewer pretty much sums it up more tactfully that I ever could. Why, Miroslav, why? His first date as a leader, ""Infinite Search,"" is essential. (""Purple,"" made with roughly the same players, is unavailable on cd--go figure.) I saw his band back in \'76--an astounding concert--in my top five, for sure. Miroslav is a great player, bandleader and composer. Why is it then that his solo output, with one, possibly two exceptions, ranges from okay (Miroslav Vitous Group/ECM) to execrable? This is one of the great mysteries of the universe."
1644,0,"Disappointing: Virtuoso bass player (capable of great things with Chick Corea, Weather Report and Jan Garbarek to name a few) floats off on a fairly self indulgent set. Aided and abetted by Don Alias (great) and lots of keyboard overdubs it has its moments but ultimately is disappointing."
1645,0,"Don't Purchase: These DVDs are absolutely rip offs. M-1 had some great fights, however you only see the action that was on broadcast TV. Each of these only come with 5 fights and many cut out rounds 1 and 2. The DVD's only hold about 50 minutes of action. I am a big time MMA Fan and these DVDs are just not worth it. HDNET should have bundled the fights together and made compilation DVDs"
1646,0,"Where's the magic?: Very little actual magic, practical or otherwise is included in this overly sentimental and boring story about sisters who grow up under the stigma of being witches. There's crying aplenty as EVERY single character breaks into tears at the drop of a hat. You read and read waiting for something to HAPPEN, but nothing interesting ever does. This is one case in which the movie was much better than the book."
1647,0,"If you want to read ""magic realism,"" read ""Turtle Moon."": As a former English teacher and lover of good fiction, I have enjoyed Alice Hoffman\'s ""Turtle Moon,"" ""Illumination Night,"" and ""Seventh Heaven."" When my daughter offered ""Practical Magic,"" I snapped it up, and read it in a day, while attending a conference in Boston. I couldn\'t believe the poor quality of the writing, when compared with ""Turtle Moon,"" say. Use of the f--- word was gratuitous, and the plot was strained to say the least. The witchy aunts (up there in Salem, I presume,) were interesting, once Hoffman got around to coloring in their sketches, in the last few pages. Lust, not true love, seemed to be the driving force. Come on, this is for ninth graders. What about the rest of us, who expect much more from Alice Hoffman? If you really want to enjoy Magic Realism, read ""Like Water for Chocolate!!"""
1648,0,"MORE LIKE UNPRACTICAL MAGIC: I finished this book in about 3 days realizing that the only thing that was noteworthy was the fact I had lost 3 days in my life to which I could have been reading something that was worthy of my time rather than wasting my time on this book. I read the book and saw the movie at the same time. If Hoffman had written a book with the same heart as the movie, maybe then I would not be so harsh. Plus, did she even do any kind of research for this book? Being a Wiccian,I am very disappointed.This girl needs to learn a few things about magic and the occult before she writes a book on it!!!!"
1649,0,"SHE VIOLATES EVERY RULE I LEARNED ABOUT WRITING: I\'m reading this book because my book club choose it. It\'s mostly narrartive. There are no scenes of action and very little dialogue. Then in part two the author switches to using the present tense which is an irrating tense to read in and certainly didn\'t make the story ""now"". I kept waiting for the real story to happen, but it doesn\'t. One thing, if writing this bad can be acclaimed, maybe my efforts have hope. I won\'t read another of her books."
1650,0,"A Bad Julia Childs meets a bad Anne Rice, where's Hoffman?: I love Alice Hoffman but think this is the worst book I have ever read by her. There are so many refrences to food and stupid ones that it reads like a bad Julia Childs cookbook, and the only magic in this book is omens. Omens like swans and black cats, a bad Anne Rice. Aside from this the story is weak and without a point. Where is the Hoffman I enjoy?"
1651,0,Not particularly impressive!!!: I simply don't know what all the fuss is about. Alice Hoffman's style of writing does not impress me in the least. Where's the dialogue!
1652,0,"Mildly disappointed: I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did the movie, usually the book are much better but I was surprisingly disappointed."
1653,0,"So where's the magic?: I read this, got done and said 'Huh? Did I miss the point?' I'm sure someone else would say 'Oh it's a character study.' Me - I like a plot. There didn't seem to be much of one here."
1654,0,"Sadly, this is one of those times where the movie is better than the book.: The author writes with an omnipresent/fairy tale voice that sometimes works in short stories, but becomes grating in novels. The characters are bizarre, not charming, with the aunts being creepy hags, Gillian a self-centered jerk, and Sally a sad sack who raises two brats. Worst of all? No real magic is presented (at least in the parts I manged to read).I got through 28% of the book on my Kindle before I got tired of waiting for the plot to show up"
1655,0,"The First Time a Movie May Be Better Than A Book: I did not like this book. Not one bit. I study the occult and the occult references in the book were hazy at best, but that is acceptable since it is meant for mainstream consumption. What got to me most about this book is that there is almost no dialog, there are periods where there are three pages without dialog, without vaugely meaninful description (like say Moby Dick), but just pure nariation. The book is written from an omni-scentiant point of view, so it is hard to care very much about any one of the characters as a main character. Now perhaps it is acceptable for Clancy to have five main characters, when he writes a 900 page book, but this book being around 250, can't support the lack of focus."
1656,0,"A Big Disappointment: After being drawn in by the magical possibilities of a Rossetti painting on the dustjacket (of the hardcover) and an epigraph from Mother Goose, I was disappointed that what followed was sheer hokum. Most disappointing: the characters are based on cliched ideas. For example, the author reinforces the tired dichotomy that women are either rational and practical or wild and irresponsible. And the author\'s primary characterization of all the prominent females in the book is that they are stunningly beautiful, as if she has nothing else in her bag of tricks to make them likable. This is a world where a woman must use her beauty to secure the love of a handsome man before she can like herself, and that is very unfortunate given the possibilities for strong feminine characters in such a storyline. The ending is likewise predictable and cloying, which seems to be a prerequisite for authors who eventually end up in the ""Oprah Bookclub."""
1657,0,Big fan of the film... not the book: I first saw the film when I was 17 and fell in love with the story. So after years of being a fan of the film I decided to try out the book. The book is nothing like the movie. I set that detail aside and decided to continue reading even though it was not the story I was hoping for. The book was dull with what I feel is poor character development. So 2 months after my purchase I still have several chapters to go and no real interest continue reading. Her style of writing is annoying at times when she tries to add poetic sequences in places where you just want information. Its likely I wont buy another book from this author.
1658,0,"Couldn't finish it.: I read one of Hoffman's other books, Illumination Night, and liked it well enough, though it seemed at time as if she were trying to imitate Anne Tyler with soem magical realism thrown in. Practical Magic started with some potential, but after about a third of the way into the book I had to stop reading. Her characers, and the way she staged their interactions, did not ring true and come to life. Rather, the book seemed mired in the emotional and imaginative level of a second-rate TV movie. All of which was especially disappointing, since Hoffman's original setup had some real potential- she just never realized it by pulling out all the stops and letting her tale set its own internal logic. Instead, she settled for cheap melodrama."
1659,0,"Really didn't like this: Anyone that loved the movie, will not like this book. I have seen the movie more times than I can count, so I was excited to get this book. I was very disappointed. The aunts really do not have a place except here and there. The closeness of all the women was just lacking to me. One of my favorite parts of the movie is what led up to Jimmy's death and the solution. So not in the book. The magic is just lacking. Sorry."
1660,0,"The movie was better, and the movie didn't thrill me.: You've read the summary, so I'll just cut to the chase. First of all, loved, loved, loved Hoffman's 'voice' and use of language: Gillian's passion for her new biology teacher lover melts all the butter in the house, a woman pounds on her lover's door until she literally breaks her hand -- Hoffman is very good at powerful, evocative images, at gliding on the surface and gazing at the tempestuous emotions below her.However, everything else about this novel began to irritate me before long. Hoffman was obsessed with pairing everyone up, down to the last obnoxious teenager, and the only romance that held any appeal for me was the one between Gillian and Ben. Gary (Sally's love interest) was boring and entered the story much too late for me. (He doesn't seem to be a very good investigator, either.) Also, the swearing seemed unnecessary, as if it came out of a different book. I might try Hoffman again, but I won't be re-reading this one."
1661,0,"Kindle price outrageous: I don't usually complain about the prices of Kindle books, but -- paperback $7, Kindle version $13? Not buying it. Not even the dead-tree version."
1662,0,"bummer: I got this because I like stories about witches, good stories. This one never made it. Badly written. No one in this book grabbed me. It had wonderful potential with moments of magic and then poof gone. What a shame. Other books of hers were much better. This one was a bummer."
1663,0,"Terrible: I have no idea how they got the movie from this awful book. It had such potential, such a unique and interesting setting, but went nowhere, did nothing! Every time it seemed like the author was moving towards something interesting, some plot point or twist, she'd just let it DROP! None of her build-ups went anywhere, leaving the plot empty and pointless. She just let everything hang in the air with nowhere to fall. And then she tried to cover up her lack of writing ability by putting an f-bomb about every other page or so. I always thought the movie had a couple of little plot holes in it, but now I know what they were working from, and the movie totally SAVED this shallow story.This is one of the ONLY times I have ever liked the MOVIE more than the BOOK! Ordinarily, I would recommend a book over its film counterpart, but in this case, I would tell anybody to watch the movie and stay far away from the book! What a staggeringly disappointing novel."
1664,0,"I DID NOT LIKE THE BOOK, COULD NOT FINISH IT: I have seen the movie and love it. I also have the soundtrack to the movie and love that. I got about half way thru the book and just stopped. I did not like the authors writing style, from a third person point of view. I could not get inside the characters because the book was not told from one of their view- points. Also, it did not flow smoothly for me. The story jumped around and did not unfold evenly. I was very disappointed. This is one case where the movie was much better than the book."
1665,0,"Sorry Alice,.....: The movie is better than the book. The character of Sally Owens is just too drab and dry in the book. Also, the aunts are barely characters."
1666,0,"poorly written: I bought this book about two years ago and couldn't get into it. After I saw the movie, I decided to give it another shot because I loved the movie. I could not believe how poorly written the book really was. The author goes back and forth between present and past tenses. She abruptly changes character viewpoints without a transition so you think you're reading about one character only to find she had changed to a different one. Very confusing. To make matters worse, she stops action right in the middle with long narrative flashbacks. The movie was a huge improvement over the book, and I actually liked it a lot. Now if I could only learn to fly off the roof..."
1667,0,"should have been better...: I have always liked the movie with Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock and I was expecting a very satisfying read. Unfortunately, Practical Magic proved to be a disappointment with its bland characters, loose plot and childish, simplistic tone. Gillian and Sally are one dimensional and mostly just pathetic. Although Sally\'s daughters are better portrayed than the grown up characters, teenage depression is simply not enough to save a lagging story. Jimmy and his angry ghost, the aunts, the conservative little town the girls grew up and Sally\'s love interest have very little place in the book and this does not help either.The only real success of the novel is Alice Hoffman\'s ability to ""feed"" magical realism into an impossible place such as the lower middle class American suburbia. Still, this does not compensate for a story that has no charm within itself."
1668,0,"Disappointing characters: I resented rewatched this movie and noticed it was based on a book so i eagerly got it for my kindle. I'm about a quarter of the way through and I'm not sure I'm going to bother to finish reading it. I'm finding the writing style a bit slow and where the movie was charming and characters were lovable, even with their flaws I'm not finding myself unsympathetic to any of the characters in the book. I'm not compelled to learn what happens to any of them because i just don't care about them. Each character is described as being totally selfish in their own way so i haven't bonded with any of the characters enough to want to read about them."
1669,0,"Decent, but I've definitely read better novels: Though the time periods and character viewpoints jump around too much, this novel about a NE family of psuedo- witches is full of lush, evocative description. I enjoyed the many descriptions of food, plants and weather, and agree it is similar to Like Water For Chocolate.However, I also agree the plot is somewhat weak, the women too obviously beautiful and somewhat lacking in real personality. This I would blame on the disappointing lack of dialogue in Practical Magic. The men are basically flat. Lust seems to be more important than love--the author seems to want to drive the point home that you cannot escape lust/love no matter how hard you try. I didn't really learn anything from this novel, especially not anything to do with Wicca, witchcraft, or New Age philosophy.Overall it's a pretty good read if you're not too fussy."
1670,0,"I just finished the book........: and after mulling it over I think that the book was OK, but not great. I admit I did see the movie several times before I bought the book, and they are VERY different from one another. The movie was much more dramatic, whereas the book(for me) moved very slowly. the aunts were not very promiant. There was barely any magic in the book and it didn't seem like much of a love story, Gary only shows up near the end. I didn't care about the characters, unlike the movie where it made me ache to have a sister! So, I went and bought the movie! I'm quite happy now."
1671,0,"I don\'t recommend this book: My niece, who LOVES Angelina, was expecting a baby sister, so I was excited to find this book. I ordered it based on the other reviews. It started well, but when I reached the page where ""At that moment she [Angelina] hated Polly [the new baby] and wished Polly would just disappear!"" I was taken aback. Hated? My 3-year old niece does not yet know that concept, and I sure didn\'t want to be the one to introduce it! On the next page Angelina has a tantrum and completely trashes her room. I decided I didn\'t want to give my niece ideas like this - and didn\'t give her book. Very disappointing."
1672,0,"Can I give it negative stars?: The moral of this book is awful! Throw enormous tantrums to get your way and if you ruin anything in the process it will be fixed. Hate your baby! I read it to my girls (wish I had read it to myself first and disposed of it) and my five year old thought very hard about it. ""Why would I make my room a big mess if you were busy with the baby? It doesn\'t make sense,"" she concluded. Good!"
1673,0,What is this teaching?: I don't know why I would present my 3 year old daughter with the idea that you can trash your room when you are angry and that we should use the word HATE towards a baby sister. This book seemingly had very little thought put into the lessons it was teaching. It is also pretty despicable how the adults in the story completely ignore Angelina when the baby comes. I wouldn't want my child to get the idea we might do that to her.
1674,0,"The weakest in the Angelina series: In ""Angelina\'s Baby Sister"", the arrival of baby sister Polly has Angelina resorting to temper tantrums and bad behavior to get her parents\' attention. I felt this was the weakest of all the books in the Angelina series due to a number of reasons: the adults seem to ignore Angelina without reassuring her from the beginning, Angelina says some very harsh words about her baby sister and uses the word ""hate"" which I deem too harsh for my preschooler to hear [she has no real concept of what the word means as she hardly ever hears it used], and in the end Angelina throws a full-scale temper tantrum, destroying her room in order to vent her anger which also seems a bit extreme.My 4-year-old and I love the books in the Angelina series and it\'s too bad that this particular book was written without too much thought put into it. The others in the series are much better, but if you\'re new to the series, you may want to skip this."

Hardly worth my time and mileage to get it repaired plus the surly repairman said I have to have a reciept which I can't locate."
1684,0,"it's not broken but it keeps falling apart: The long tube that's supposed to nest into the longer bits of the tube or the attachments does not fit well enough. During ten minutes of vacuuming, I probably have to pick up falling pieces about three or four times. The two attachments (a brush and angled-looking thing) also fall off (as does the head of the vacuum) and do not fit easily back into their holding place in the canister. The canister doesn't roll so much as gets dragged behind you since it constantly flips onto its side. The vacuum also takes up a surprising amount of storage space since the tube loops out from the body. In addition, the vacuum is difficult to get in and out of storage because the tube merely rests in place so it gets easily knocked over. There is also no good way to carry the vacuum when not in use. I really really really hate this vacuum."
1685,0,On/off switch broke: Nice vacuum. Easy light but poor quality. The on/off switch broke after 6 months. Also cord is too short.Closest repair center is at >20 miles. Not worth the effort for a $60 vacuum. Doubting whether to buy the same one again of a more expensive Miele.
1686,0,"Great hat, poor service.: This item was ordered the afternoon of Dec. 19th 2012 as a Christmas gift. They shipped the item Dec. 24th! Didn't receive it until January 2nd. Cap is perfect fit and excellent embroidery.Different color was purchased separately, knowing it was late but still as another gift for the holidays. (Red with yellow flame cap) Ordered on Dec. 21st. Shipped on Dec 27th. Received it January 5th. Cap was frayed at not less than 5 spots in the embroidery. Pay for shipping yet again? Not worth it...Very irritated with this vendor"
1687,0,"Won't last long!: Save your money! It will be strong at first, but won't last anywhere near the original battery power. You'll be lucky if you get several months out of this thing. I wound up charging it as much as my old one that was dying. It's smarter and cheaper to just buy a new phone when it's time to re-new your plan, like I did."
1688,0,DuD: This was a nice looking timer but right out of the box was a DUD.Would not work at all at first.Then it started working after bending the a/c prongs a bit.Ran about 6 hr. with pump and it got hot and quit.Will trash this as its not worth going through the return crap.
1689,0,"Very poor quality and zero manufacturer support: Very disappointed in the quality and performance of the Intermatic P1101 outdoor timer. It does not turn on by itself because the on mechanism is too strong or stiff for the timer to overcome. If you physically turn it past the set on time it works correctly, but does not keep accurate time - it shuts off over 1 hour earlier than it is set to turn off. I have tried many different set points, both on and off and it is the same result every time. I have sent Intermatic technical support several emails regarding this problem and they have not responded. I called several times and finally after 5 attempts I was able to get an agent on the phone, he asked many questions and gave no solutions other than that I should go buy a new one (this one is only 1 month old and still under manufacturer warranty but no advice or offer of assistance was given. Never buy intermatic products again."

I want nothing more from CHINA !!!!!!!!"
1691,0,"Such poor quality!: I guess I should have known that the quality of the movies on this DVD would be poor. But I was stoked to find 3 movies that I love on the same DVD. Great movies, very poor quality.It would be more wise to spring for each movie seperately."
1692,0,"Poor quality: This is a very poor quality dvd! I don't recommend buying it. For example, the picture in Charades jumps up and down the whole time. I have the video version of Charades and it is an excellent picture."
1693,0,"Not good when using video sources: The picture is fine when using the cable jack, but when watching a DVD or VHS hooked up through the video in jacks, there are white vertical bars on the screen. They are very noticeable when the background is dark and especially when watching a wide screen DVD with the black areas on top and bottom. I took mine back and was going to try another of the same model, but even the demo in the store I was in did the same thing. I eventually bought a different brand because of this."
1694,0,"Not good for a betta: I purchased this because we have a betta and silk plants are recommended so as to not tear their fins. I was disappointed at the quality of this plant. The plant we received has plastic burs and is missing some leaves. Only the leaves are ""silk;"" the stem is hard plastic. I also couldn\'t find anything on the package that actually said the plant is ""silk."" The leaves are not super soft. The one I received doesn\'t look as ""full"" as the one pictured. I won\'t be returning this because it\'s not worth the hassle but I will not be putting it in our betta\'s tank."
1695,0,Not a Green Shipper: Average for a plastic plant. I would never order again because of the huge box it was mailed to filled with plastic air protectors. Extremely wasteful. No green shipper here.

1698,0,"THIS WON'T MAKE YOU HAPPY: There are bad movies, and there are badder movies. And then there are simply TERRIBLE movies. This is one of them, an indie that can only serve to prove that MOST (not all, now) indies are movies made by intellectuals who think they have something important or 'artsy' to say, but manage to say nothing. This abominable film is one of the worst movies I've ever suffered through. A plot that makes no sense whatsoever with performances that are stifling and unbelievable, and no semblance of coherency at all. David Arquette should start being a stay at home husband for Courteney, and Ally Sheedy needs to retire. As for Clarence Williams III, he should stay in retirement and watch THE MOD SQUAD or something more productive. Nothing saves this awful mess."

Sounded like air or something was caught in the impeller, but its perfectly clean, the pump is submerged completely. Pulled off the impeller to see if anything was caught, but it was perfectly clean. The Danner Mfg website is of no help. Also for the 1 hour or so it did work, the output was much less than expected (barely more than my 300gph we were replacing). All in all I'm quite disappointed."
1702,0,"Pondmaster Mag pump 9.5B: Purchased a Pondmaster Pump 9.5 as a replacement pump for my Koi pond. Their product is very cheaply made and does not last much longer than their warranty. Shortly after being in use for a little more than a year, the shaft in the impeller broke due to being made of plastic. This is the first impeller I have seen using plastic! This product is not recommended! Replacement parts are available but the cost does not warrant replacing. What will you receive? More plastic!"
1703,0,Pond pump: Have had for less than a year. It quit working totally after about 6 months. We didn't bother looking at it until now since winter was coming and we didn't need it anyway. It already has loose parts and needs either repaired or replaced.
1704,0,"Kindle edition is awful.: Occasionally, and especially in non-English words, some letters are replaced with random punctuation marks. Annoying, but can usually be figured out with context. What's really frustrating is that significant and often pivotal portions of the story have been COMPLETELY EDITED OUT. See if ' Fall of the House of Usher' makes any sense to you with Roderick Usher's final, climactic line entirely omitted, for example. Almost all verse and quotations have been omitted as well."
1705,0,"this volume for kindle is garbage: But then again, what do you expect from a free book? every single punctuation mark in the book is replaced with symbols like @ # $ % ^ & * ( ).... Whoever the hell made this version for the kindle needs a good slap in the face."
1706,0,"Don't Buy the Kindle Edition!: The Kindle edition was obviously digitally scanned and MANY characters have been replaced by question marks or blank spaces. It makes the text very difficult to read, especially as Poe liked to pepper his short stories with quotes in Latin, Greek and French. I highly recommend Poe's short stories - it's just this edition that stinks."
1707,0,".: not a kindle fan. downloaded because it was free. didnt redownload the app on my new phone and anyways, this was all mised up, pages not in order."
1708,0,"Find another version: Like the others here that have noted the missing portions of the text (including the entire poem missing from the middle of Fall of the House of Usher), screwed up words, missing quotes, etc. I was highly annoyed by this. If you need it for anything other than pleasure reading, find a better copy."
1709,0,Get out your magnifying glass: Get out your magnifying glass and decoder ring cause you're going to need them to read this book.Actually under sufficient magnification and in the right light it looks like an old typewriter font with a really bad ribbon and then shrunken and shoved together.I am over 50 but I have brand new glasses. My wife is younger and does not ware glasses. She took one look and laughed.The paper stock is unremarkable but the largish format looks like it might be just the right size for a bird cage. It might also be good for starting fires but I have not tested this yet.
1710,0,"I wouldn't bother: While I found the idea of the book interesting, the execution was boring in the extreme. I'd be reading along and then find myself thinking about something else altogether (like, say housework). I think if the author had stuck to fewer, better developed characters, it would have been much more satisfying. As it is, it reads more like an outline than a book."
1711,0,"It doesn't make sense: I rarely flame a book, because I know what it takes to put one together. However, The Bridge doesn't make sense for so many reasons. The characters are not real. I cannot imagine a mother committing suicide right after giving birth. It is not realistic to believe food would start flowing back to the cities after a pandemic virus wipes out 4 billion people. And who kept the power grid running during this disaster?Yes, there is a sci-fi premise regarding first contact (sort of), but humanity tends to react a bit differently in the light of megadeath than what was depicted here."
1712,0,"Not really SF: This is more of a popular fiction novel with a science fiction theme than a true science fiction novel. It is hard to explain the difference, but it has to do with the way that the novel sets up the characters and progresses through the plot, and the writing style itself. The idea is a good one, but the presentation left me cold. Maybe I\'m just a ""literary SF"" snob, but if you are too, you\'ll be disappointed in this novel."
1713,0,"No Nick, No QOTSA: After several listening attempts I'm convinced that all the songs on this cd were leftovers from the last desert sessions. Nick was, without a doubt, the creative force in this band and his lack of presence is noticed on every song. Songs for the Deaf offered a glimpse of great things to come, but all good things come to an end. An exteremly boring and average desert sessions, then a slightly less boring and average Eagles of Death Metal, and now this. I can only be thankful that PJ Harvey doesn't moan and wail on this cd. Keep your finger near the fast forward button, or just stick with the old stuff."
1714,0,"This CD is so overrated.......: Alright, it's getting two stars because there's two good songs on it, and that's the ONLY reason it gets two stars. This CD and this band is so over rated it makes me sick. If they would have been around say 20 years ago, they would have fit right in with their 80s hair band sounding drivel. The lyrics aren't bad, there's a few lines that make you go HELL YEAH, but for the most part, BOREDOM sets in around the 4th or 5th track. And only lets up on one or two songs. So I've already let it go to someone else who wanted the CD but couldn't pay for it. I'll stick with my obscure bands that no one has ever heard of. As for this CD, the best thing about it is the cover. SO, goodbye QOTSA, until next time......."
1715,0,"the album title says it all...: After just playing the album through for the first time before writing this review, I realize I haven\'t given what I just heard much time to sink in, but since first impressions are everything, I\'m gonna share mine. This album is boring, it has no emotion, it all sounds the same, and the title was right on the money...""lullabies to paralyze"", because that\'s all this album will do to/for you...put you to sleep. I don\'t quite get why a a lot of the american public has a boner for this band, because if this album has anything to say about it, there\'s some poor tastes in music out there. Have I heard crappier music than this? of course. could I make a better album myself? of course not. but for the hype that surrounds this band, this is unacceptable."
1716,0,"HORRIBLE!!!!: I hate this album! I ended up giving it away it sucked so much! the only DECENT song is Little Sister, and that gets old fast!"
1717,0,"Ehhhhh...: The title definitely fits the album's songs. This album is pretty boring, especially by Kyuss and previous QOTSA standards. There just doesn't seem to be any creativity in any of the songwriting. In most of the songs, it's the same riff or lick over and over. There are practically no bridges, tempo or melody changes in the course of any of the songs. And there is really no edge to most of the songs. They seem to just drone on. Only Medication, Everybody Knows That You're Insane, and Tangled Up In Plaid save this album to some extent. Overall, extremely weak."
1718,0,"What a letdown!! Don\'t waste yer $$: Big fan of Kyuss. Liked ""Restricted"". LOVED ""Songs""- thought it was brilliance. But this, sorry to say, is a total disappointment. Where\'s the aggression? The melody? The balls? The hooks? the SONGS?? It\'s like Homme took all his most repetitive ideas and made a messy, boring joke just to see who was still listening. There\'s the odd good riff; he\'s talented, after all. But mostly it\'s totally flat. I hate it. I\'m giving my copy away. Spend your dinero on the new ""Corrosion of Conformity"" instead, it\'s MUCH, MUCH better music. Peace!"

1723,0,"like a broken record: a couple of the songs are good, but most are so repetitive that the album on the whole is just boring. these guys need to take a Learning Annex class on writing a bridge or something."
1724,0,"The older stuff was better: The CD is ok. Not great, not horrid.I only enjoyed maybe 4 songs max on this CD, and yes Little Suster was one of those 4. My advice would be to wait until you can get the CD for under 10 bucks, then make your own decision."
1725,0,"More like a Josh Homme solo album...: This was bound to happen. After the brilliant ""Songs for the deaf"" they release ""Lullabies to Paralyze"". Why do I say ""they""? There is no ""They"" anymore. There\'s only Josh Homme with some session-musicians. Songs for the deaf had Nick Olivieri, Mark Lanegan and Dave ""bleepin\'"" Grohl! Nick Olivieri\'s absence takes away their edge, Mark Lanegan only sings the intro, and well the new drummer is NO DAVE GROHL!!!The sound leans toward the Debut album. But it\'s not as good as the debut album either.I think it could have been a lot better if only Nick had stayed, I mean everyone knew Grohl & Lanegan wouldn\'t stay permanently. But losing Olivieri? He gave them that edge. Homme is more of a ""tripper"". As we can hear on this album. Still I like the single ""Little Sister"" and there are more catchy tunes here. But it should have been credited as a Josh Homme solo album."
1726,0,"This book cries out for an editor: The premise of this book is simple: (1) People spend too much money on luxury goods, (2) less wealthy people spend more on luxury goods because super rich people spend a great deal, and (3) we'd all be better off if people spent less on luxury goods and more on helping others. Everything of value in this book might make a short article in a magazine - expanding it into a book makes it mind numbing. Unless you have an extremely high tolerance for reading the same thing over and over, pass on this book."

The book progressivly steps you through the arguments, starting with1. Something is terribly wrong with the way we're living today2. It's because we're making poor decisions on what we spend money on3. We'd all be happier if we paid a lot more taxes.No joke!He makes passing references to the failure of centrally planned economies, but doesn't appear to have drawn any real lessons from them.

1731,0,"Two thumbs down: I picked up this book while vacationing in the southwest. The subject sounded interesting. If only the story had been written by a ghost writer it may have been worth the time taken to read it. Blessings is a juvenile rendering of a love story. It's written on the level of teenage romance novels, but I doubt if any teenagers would find it any more engaging than I did. This is a story of an educated, older man approached by a young Navajo woman with aspirations of attending college. Unfortunately, from the moment they met, all of her goals for higher education were completely ignored all to pander to her husband's ego. Don't waste your time. The other reviews must have been written by friends."

1739,0,Unworthy of Thirkell: I love the Thirkell books but this one is an aberration. It's trite and obvious. The characters are not particularly interesting. It's as if the author decided to try something different -- and it didn't work. Skip this one and read her other works.
1740,0,"What was Angela thinking?: I love Angela Thirkell's books--she is one of my favorite authors along with Trollope and Austen. But she wrote a few clinkers, and this is one of them. I would have guessed that Georgette Heyer wrote this book, in a blind test. It has all the cloying archness of the (only) book by Heyer I read and which I forever associate with Regency romances. Of course, this IS a Regency romance--NOT one of her wonderful Barsetshire books, so maybe it was a misguided experiment."
1741,0,The font is too small.: This book would be so much better if the music was readable. The typeset is too small. The book also needs a spiral binding so that it doesn't close on itself.
1742,0,"easily removable while locked: This cap seemed good at first. However closer inspection reveals that this will only deter the least determined of gas theives, and is more of a visual deterrent then an actual security device.A close look at the design of my filler neck reveals the nubs on the cap just sit behind the guides on the filler neck. They don't lock in. What this means is that if you pull up on the cap and turn, there is a friction battle between where the spinning top contacts the base of the cap and the nubs against filler neck. Guess which has less friction... the nubs against the filler neck. For this design to work, the cap would need to spin on ball bearings, or something else that has less friction then the nubs against the filler neck.Bottom line: If you pull up on the locked cap with gentle to moderate force and turn the cap, it comes right off. The design of the filler neck plays a role, so this may not be true for all cars, however it is true for my Saturn Ion."

With gas prices steadly rising, I would not recomended this to consumers.And if you live in an area when an emmissions test is required to obtain an inspection sticker, the leaking fumes will cause your car to fail."

I love old black and white movies, especially film noir, but the lighting is amateurish, the acting is very stiff, the ideas are idiotic (they arrest a woman for murder because she attempts suicide), the makeup is incredibly poor (one man\'s gray hair looks like it was applied with house paint), the music is suddenly loud for no reason, but the writing should get a special award for stupidity. There is a wandering, nonsensical, and boring plot line that could not be saved with the greatest of actors, and they certainly are not that. Having seen it all the way through, I have no idea what a ""Big Combo"" is or why anyone wanted to make this movie. It is so bad I will hesitate to order a Big Combo the next time I want fries with my hamburger. I\'m actually sorry that I have to give it one star. Stinko!"

1751,0,"toy is smaller than dimensions indicate: While I\'m sure the product itself is fine, the dimensions are inaccurate. The toy is at best 4"" long, not 5\' and when you have slightly larger dogs than can destroy a smaller toy, that inch matters. Hopefully it will last longer than a week."
1752,0,"Cute, but didn\'t last long!: When I got this in the mail, it was a very cute little toy and my dog loved to chew on it...for the whole 20 minutes that it lasted. The first thing she did was turn the little tail into a nub, and then she chewed through the neck and actually separated the head from the rest of the body. It was nice while it lasted, but I was expecting a bit more from a toy that is called ""ruffians."" The only toys my dog hasn\'t been able to kill, although this was very quick by her standards, are the West Paw ones."
1753,0,"Not Durable: This toy may say that it is durable, but when miniature Dachshunds can destroy these toys in less than 15 minutes there must be a problem. They pulled the sqeaker out and bit the tails off. The squeaker is a major choke hazard for any size dog and if ingested could be deadly. Don't by this toy if you are looking for durability. I also bought another JW toy with this same purchase. More of a joke than these turtles. Also boasted about the durability factor. HA"

A friend recommended each night before you go to bed, to list 5 things that you were grateful for that day -- and try not to repeat. It is harder than you think, but very rewarding."
1755,0,"In theory, a good idea...: I foget to write in it, it's prob my own issue, but there is no ongoing reading so I basically read the intro, wrote in it a couple of days and forgot about it..."
1756,0,IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS: The idea behind this journal -- to each day write down 5 things you are grateful for -- is a good one. But this is simply a poorly designed book without enough room allotted to write down one's thoughts. It's just not worth the price. Buy one of the countless -- and less expensive -- journals currently on the market and keep your gratitude log in that.

1759,0,"Absolutely blah!: I don't know what I was expecting when I purchased this book! It is a journal, but the spaces allotted for each day are quite small. Perhaps the author didn't anticipate that some people have large handwriting or that others would have a lot to say. I never used it, and would not recommend it. Buy a journal with larger spaces!"
1760,0,"not enough writing space: I bought this journal along with Simple Abundance: A Daybook of Comfort and Joy. The cover is nice (hard) and there is a string to mark your place. There is also a large list in the front of often overlooked things to be thankful for on the days that you're having trouble coming up with something. However, I was unable to actually use the journal for the simple fact that there is not enough space to write! Each day only provides 5 lines and the lines were not enough for me to write a complete sentence across, even writing small. I didn't want to limit my ability for expression each day, so I bought another gratitude journal that provides an entire page for each day. You could really use any blank journal also, as the journal itself doesn't have prompts or any necessary information."

Whoopee! :-D I do want to point out that I like stupid stoner films and I can watch the dumbest of dumb when it come to them, but this film is boring, stupid and should have nothing of interest for anyone.

1772,0,"Not for DCR-DVD 505: Main problem: it is WAY too small. It has room for the camera, and pretty much nothing else. None of the stock accessories like charging cords and such fit in it, much less any add-ons you may have bought or blank DVDs. This means you'll need a second case for all your accessories. I suppose it would be ok for a day bag if all you wanted to carry was the camera, but it just doesn't cut it as a main storage bag.Second problem: the battery is a joke. It is about half the thickness of the stock battery that comes with the DCR-DVD 505 (which itself, is two steps down from the highest capacity battery Sony offers as of 5/06). I don't even want to speculate on how quickly it would run out.In short, this kit is useless for the current generation of cameras. Buy a separate bag (I'm about to order the Sony LCSVA5) and if you need a spare battery, get a quality one."

1776,0,Complete Sumi-e Techniques NOT Very Good Condition!: This book was supposed to be in very good condition. It is not. Its cover is about to come off; the whole spine inside the cover is visible; the edges are ragged; in short it is in poor condition. I would hope the store would offer return compensation or another book in its place. Its the worse book I've ever received.
1777,0,Poor explanations for answers.: I found that the explanations given for the answers are unsatisfactory. On the tougher problems (Bin 3) too many of the explantions were to plug in the choices given and see if they work. Some explanations were unecessarily complicated.The good news is that the CD rom works in this edition but the drawback is that the CD rom has no explantions for answers.
1778,0,"Hard to know what to say about this album ............: I bought this and found nothing of interest. But in saying that, it might just be me. The Indian/Jazz flavor is fairly unrelenting, whereas western melodic influences have sneaked through on their other albums. I like Indian, and I like Jazz, but for some reason Indian Jazz just doesn't do it."
1779,0,not the same one!: It is not the same one as in the picture so dont be fooled. Was excited only to be so disappointed. It seems like it has a different formulation and it definitely has a different packaging so we ended up wasting our money..

1784,0,"Off-base book by a sincere but misguided man.: Harold Camping's odd work is heavily influenced by numerology, a psuedo-science influenced by ancient mysticism that trys to find hidden truth behind literal meanings of the Bible.The book is filled with strange assumptions based upon allegory mixed with ignorance. Camping's logic is so inconsistent that it should be required reading for students taking NUTCASE 101 .The Bible stands true without Mr. Camping's distortions of the greatest book ever written."
1785,0,"Welcome to Open Forum...: I listened to Open Forum during my college years from about 1992-1994, during which time I began to buy into some of the bible teachings of Mr. Camping. But, I became confused after he started asserting that he knew when Christ would return, since by this time I thought that he did have a deeper understanding of the Bible than most. To me, it was quite clear that from Matthew 24:36 - But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. So, I bought the book anyway to see what was said. So, people are willing to believe Mr. Camping's complex manipulations of the scripture and ignore the clear teaching of Matthew. I understand Christians' desire for the return of Christ, but that has been the case for over 2000 years. Now I read that Mr. Camping is asking people to leave their churches. Poor sools that follow after this deceived man. Just live your life as Christ lived His and submit yourself to his Church."

1788,0,"Unimpressed: I purchased these at Baby's R Us because of the good reviews, but I have not had any luck with them. They didn't pull the nipple out far enough to make any difference, and the pressure on the nipple made me leak constantly. I would soak through a cloth pad in a couple of hours. They are suppose to have a reservoir to catch the milk, but your nipple must protrude a certain distance in order for the shell to work. My nipples were too flat, so I just ended up with wet, smelly breasts.They are also very large and extremely noticeable - there is no way I would wear them in public.I also think a previous reviewer got the medela shell types mixed up. This shell does not have a foam insert, and is hard plastic."
1789,0,"Advice on sound quality - Japan release: As many have said the remastering done on this version lacks bass and medium. Although this is the most complete best of of the group on two cds, if you want the best songs AND the best sound quality, I recommend you the Japan-only 2009 best of called ""Fantasy"":http://www.amazon.com/Fantasy-Perfect-Best-Earth-Wind-Fire/dp/B001O7713W/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s;=music&qid;=1273528510&sr;=1-5It is relatively cheap for a Japanese release and the sound is much better than ""The Essential"" release. It is probably the best sounding best of of the group currently on the market.For those interested, the Blu-spec Japanese release of ""The Essential"" does not add anything to the sound quality (blu-spec being a technology on the format of the CD, not on the sound)."
1790,0,"Good songs but what about the sound quality?: After several years of waiting, Sony finally put out a great selection of EW&F songs in one package while utilizing a 24 Bit Mastering system. That's Good, but judging from the sound quality it was clear to me that the original master tapes were NOT used! They were so close to getting it right and they blew it! I have no choice but to give this inadequate sounding album 1 star!"
1791,0,"This offer is a joke...I only gave it 1 star because they forced me to: This should be a zero star rating!If you are looking for the entire Final Four...you will not find it here.As a Kansas alum, fan, and native Kansan...this DVD bothers me greatly. I would guess that many fans will want the full national semi-final game just as much as the championship game, but you will not get it here. The KU vs. UNC game has random cuts in the action. I was lucky enough to see a replay before the national title game, but I would prefer to own that UNC stomping in its entirety.I just do not understand why the NCAA cannot get it right. The best DVD set I have purchased was the 2004 Red Sox set. I would happily pay extra to get all the Kansas tourney games, but I guess this is the best you can hope for this year. The sad thing is that the bare bones 1988 KU DVD that is two separate DVDs is even better than this one."
1792,0,"Agree: I agree with other reviewers regarding Jarrett. His noises are irritating and distracting not unlike in his own 1970s live solo effort, ""Koln Concert"". The sound engineers at ECM need to seriously considering editing these grunts and groans when remastering these discs."
1793,0,"Don't await it's being back in stock too eagerly: I agree very strongly with most of the other reviewers. Jarrett's foolishness really makes this date worthless. Luckily, there is plenty of other DeJohnette and Peacock material available. On this date they certainly gained nothing from Jarrett.I wouldn't go so far as to say that Jarrett never made a good recording, but his musicianship is highly overrated in general. If you want to hear Peacock with a much greater pianist, listen to his work with Marc Copland, for example. I notice that this CD is not very easy to obtain (Amazon has been out of stock for a while at the time of this writing). It is definitely not worth spending your time and money to locate this one!"

1798,0,"A simple thought on ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"": Hiroshima Mon Amour is the first foriegn film with sub-titles I\'ve watched. I watched it for my film class.It was very slow, but the music helped push it along. The music helped set the mood for the graphic images it portrayed.I found the plot confusing, all the changes in time made it hard to follow. It was like a documentary gone bad. I think the love story made it cheaper, especilally since it was an affair.I did like however, the tie ins with the affair and the bombing. That was creative, although not a film I would sit at home and watch on a Saturday night."
1799,0,"Misguided, to say the least: The Bottom Line:A film that seems more like a project from film school than something people would still praise a half-century after its release, Hiroshima Mon Amour is a bizarre combination of romantic narrative and documentary about the atomic bomb which fails completely to find a compelling reason for its own existence; one of those films that people praise primarily because it's different, without looking to see if there's anything of substance behind the iconoclasm of the director, this is a film that should be viewed only by those who wish to study the cinematic equivalent of a dish which combines candy corn and foie gras.2/4"

These guys are capable of so much more. I mean, maybe if you like trendy, meaningless lyrics and polished teeny-bopper music, this cd may be good for you. If you are a long time fan of a band that used to be play decent punk rock like myself, don't even waste your money. I have been to several UL shows over the years and own every album, and this is disgraceful to their talent. If you are new to the band, I would suggest buying Oz Factor or the self-titled album. They are wonderful cd's and are still on my favorites list. Here's to the Morning unfortunatley will never grace my cd player again. It is directed towards a totally new audience this time and I guess I am not a part of it. Scott Russo, why did you have to sell out?"

Other than Save Me and The Celebration Song, the rest of the albulm fell flat. I am all for change and everything, but compaired to all of thier other cd's this one was scary. I don't know what type of genre they are trying to become, but the hard rock vibe does not work well with Scott Russo's voice. I don't know what I expected, but this was not it.

These dirtbike fanboy losers need to give it up and start a lame clothing company like SKIN already and stop poisoning the airwaves with their mediocre, copycat radio rock! Bottom line...this band sucks and so does anyone who thinks this Cd isn't a waste of the fossil fuels used to make the plastic that contains it!"
1804,0,"Hmmm...: Unwritten Law has gone slightly downhill. On Elva, we saw some good old fashioned punk-rock laced with some slightly harder content. Also, it had some pretty good lyrics. I picked up \'Here\'s to the Mourning\' expecting it to be more of the same, if not slightly harder. What I got was dumbed down, ""why can\'t I be on the radio?"" modern rock. For example, the lyrics are just inane, making no sense, merely trying to rhyme wherever it seems like it needs to. You\'ll hear nothing really new here, just some tired riffs and progressions that you\'ve doubtless heard before in other places.On the plus side, this IS Unwritten Law, and some of the songs are undeniably catchy and good to bounce your head to. I just think that this band is capable of much better music. This one\'s a miss, but I sure hope that their next album shows recovery."

1806,0,Poor Quality: The business that shipped the product did a good job. The product itself is not at all worth the cost. It doesn't look as good in person as it does online. It is very poor quality even by made in Taiwan standards. I've seen the same type item in Best Buy and it is significantly better made and all said and done costs about $3 more than this one when you include shipping. I wish I would have spent 3 more dollars.
1807,0,"Save Your Money, Don't Bother: In a word, this product: sucks. I received this as a Christmas gift and it was a big disappointment. To start with, it's poorly made- it looks like something a 6-year-old made at summer camp. Secondly, it seems to only fit Ipod Mini's correctly. I had to jam my 20g in there and it kept sliding out. Good luck with getting a 40g in there... Next, you can't use the click-wheel on the Ipod behind the thick plastic screen so forget about volume control or skipping a song. What a huge rip off. Last, the armband probably will fit a 6-year-old, everyone else will have loss of circulation problems. Amazon really should re-evaluate working with this vendor."

I saw Bergman's masterpiece Persona at the movies a very long time ago. Over the decades I have remembered it as shocking and terrifying, yet appealing and beautiful. I got excited when I learned of its released on DVD. Now I've watched MGM's life-less and cropped presentation of it, and associate the movie with dullness and disappointment. Bergman is a master who MGM do not respect. Tartan's release (region 0!!) of the film is supposed to be much better, but with less extras (doesn't matter to me, I just want the movie). I'm waiting for my copy to arrive :)"
1813,0,"Detached monstrosity of a film. In a word: boring!: I fell asleep four times trying to watch this enigmatic masterpiece. The only thing that could have wrapped this mess up would have been a car crash killing the two leads. Instead, at the end, what we get is this flash of a movie crew to further frustrate the totally disinterested and removed viewer. What was that all about? I would have rewound the tape, but was tired and ready for this project to come to an end. How can so many people like this?! What about a story for crying out loud?! The most interesting scene is when Bibi Andersson freaks out and repeatedly slaps Liv Ullman in the face. It's kind of over-the-top--something you'd see in a Saturday Night Live skit. And please, no comments about how I'm missing the meaning, the poetry, the depth. First spark my interest, move me in some way, and then we'll discuss depth. In a word, BORING."

1815,0,"Bergman is a bad director: Bergman is a terrible director. All of his movies have horrible dialog and next to no story. He rarely has a resolution to what little story he does provide. Most of his films just force symbolism down your throat like so much tripe. I don't understand how he became world famous. Persona is especially the case, the only good thing about this film is the cinimatography, which alone does not make a good movie."

That should be it's title, or at least the Amazon descrition.If that's what you are looking to do - then this book will get you started. However, if you are looking for details of how to use windows media in applications (as I was) - this isn't the book."
1819,0,Not worth it: This book is really a complete waste of money - it can only be used for developing quick and dirty solutions using the windows media player and so on.I wouldn't recommend this book even to my most hateful enemy. Unfortunately I was deceived by its looks.
1820,0,"Only lasted a year: Purchased the battery in February 2008. Worked fine size and power wise with my OEM charger and TZ3 camera though it seemed to last a few shots less than the original Panasonic battery (CGA-S007A). However, starting a few weeks ago, the battery refused to charge the full time and dies extremely quickly when placed in my camera. It's been less than 1.5 years. The battery has a 3 year warranty on it but Lenmar charges $7.50 shipping and handling for warranty returns over 90 days.Cheap price but not a recommended purchase."
1821,0,Did not work in my Lumix: The battery I was sent did not work in my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K digital camera.
1822,0,Wrong Battery: The Battery I received was for a completely different camera. Although the company eventually gave me my credit and sent a mailer for the wrong battery nobody contacted me with the correct battery for my camera.
1823,0,"Not enough lasting energy.: It's ok but last only a few hours, at least with my TZ3. I'd buy the Panasonic one. I know for next time."
1824,0,"Short life and poor quality control: Purchased 2 Lenmar DLP007 batteries to be used with Panasonic TZ3 digital camera.One battery was dead after 1 charge cycle. Lenmar did replaced that.Then during the past year, I continued to use Panasonic original battery and the 2 Lenmar batteries on regular rotation. Now, Panasonic battery still allows me to take 100+ photos easily. One Lenmar battery is now completely dead (cannot be recharged). The 2nd Lenmar battery holds only a fraction of the charge, maybe good for 30 photos.So you might be able to get 6 months to 1 year worth of useful life out of the batteries, and then they do not hold the charge any more. These batteries are around half the price of Panasonic original batteries, but the useful life is not half of Panasonic battery."
1825,0,"doesnt hold charge: this is a product that holds true to the statement "" you get what you pay for"" it doesn\'t come close to the performance on the factory battery. it is good only as a back up, but not as the primary battery. if you want the performance equal to a factory unit buy a factory unit. if your primary runs out and you only need a few more pictures this is fine."
1826,0,POOR LIFE....NOT RECOMMENDED: Bought 2 of these fron ADORAMA and I am not happy. I get about 50 shots w/ my Panasonic TZ5 camera and the battery is DEAD. My OE battery is good for 300-400 shots.
1827,0,"Don't waste your money.: I didn't notice until we went on vacation what a difference there is between this battery and the real Panasonic battery! This battery cannot last for a normal vacation day of pictures! Fortunately, I brought the Panasonic battery along on that first day out and could go back to the car and change batteries! From then on I made sure to only use this battery at night while I was charging up the Panasonic battery for the next days shooting!Don't depend on this battery! It will let you down!"
1828,0,"No enough time.: Now I know why there's a difference in the price. This battery doesn't last for more than a few hours, no flash and using normally. Could be a back up of the back up while you charge any of the good ones. My advise; get the Panasonic one."
1829,0,"The battery I received was defective: I bought this battery for my new camera Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3K. I charged it several times, but there was no voltage at all.I also notices that when it was charging, the light on the charger was flashing, this usually indicates the battery/charger connector is dirty or defective. I was sure the charger was ok since I had no problem to charge the original battery that came with the camera. So I used a dry cloth to clean the new battery connector and charged it again, the light was still flashing. But I went ahead to charge it overnight anyway, but it still did not work, I had to return the battery."
1830,0,"lenmar dlp007: Received a Lenmar branded battery as advertised. Works fine in my Lumix DMC-TZ5, but definitely does not last as long as the OEM Panasonic battery, maybe 1/2 to 1/3 of the life of the Panasonic battery. For the price, its a good emergency backup but wouldn't use it as a replacement of the OEM battery."
1831,0,"Not as good as I hoped: I read all the reviews of this battery and there seemed to be a distinct difference of opinions. Most people seemed to think it worked as well as the Panasonic battery that came with their camera and others disagreed. I hoped those who said it was equivalent were correct, but my own experience is that it just doesn't last like the original. So I have to join with those who got less than equal effectiveness."
1832,0,"Does not last: Upon recieving this Lenmar battery, I inserted it into the Panasonic DMC-TZ3 charger and it readily charged with no problem. (Some reviews I read indicated a problem with this Lenmar battery fitting into the charger which I did not encounter.) I then put it in the camera and it has functioned as well as the original equipment. I have not used the camera enough to determine if there is any significant difference in usage time between it and the original Panasonic battery, but it is certainly a bargain price.UPDATE: After using this battery for a year it started not to hold a charge very long and eventually it would hardly work at all, so after usage, I found tis battery to be unsatisfactory and not that good a bargain. I am still using the original battery taht came with the camers from over 2 years ago. And I recently bought another backup battery on Amazon which seems to be working fine."
1833,0,"LENMAR DLP007 BATTERY IS GARBAGE: THIS BATTERY IS GOOD FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 SHOTS BEFORE IT MUST BE RECHARGED, WHILE THE ORIGINAL PANASONIC BATTERY IS GOOD FOR 100 TO 200 SHOTS AND VIDEOS BEFORE NEEDING A RECHARGE."
1834,0,"Not for MTA: If you are taking the ATD test for NYCT MTA don't waste your money with this book. Where it is not completely irrelevant, it is completely out of date. Depend solely on this book and you will fail."
1835,0,"The gimmick falls flat: The gimmick of this guide to correct word choice lies in its mock-gothic style, à la Edward Gorey, with improbably passages illustrating the words defined. But the gimmick falls flat by trying far too hard. I loved Gordon\'s ""Paris Out of Hand,"" but in this book the mock-gothic prose is half-baked and monotonous."
1836,0,"Not as good the second time around: I first read this book when I was in junior high and I loved it. I gave it a second go as a 30 year old and did not have the same experience at all. I didn't like the main characters, I didn't like the writing, I thought the story was weak and there was tons of stereotyping. I felt like the author kept on leading us down dead end allies and then didn't pay up when the climax hit. Not my cup of tea, I suppose."
1837,0,"Live at Full House: Buy this to collect the TSC in full, as I did. I\'d still have bought it, if I\'d known it was the worst TSC concert I\'ve heard. It goes less than 40 mins too.I was looking forward to hearing songs from ""The Cost of Loving"" LP, but (like every tune on this concert), ""Heavens Above"", ""Walking the Night"" have most of the melody taken out of them.""Heaven\'s Above"" (my favourite tune on the original studio album) is played much faster, and without the great sound on ""Cost of Loving.""There wasn\'t one song on here I actually enjoyed, and visually the council\'s outfits didn\'t have the same debonair look of ""Showbiz"" (a much better concert to be released on the upcoming 2008 ""Style Council on film"" DVD.)"
1838,0,"The early stuff was better: While Breaking God's Heart is not without some merit, it is a shadow of the band's exciting and innovative first two singles issued on the little-known BoogleWonderland label. Clearly Hayman has been corrupted by the cancer of materialism and, as he suggests, is more interested in buying a house than making music with real integrity."
1839,0,"Hair Bow selection not as described: The description on this product clearly states 'hair bows', and then lists 5 separate colors. However, what I received was 1 bow, for $10 plus $6.95 shipping. I will say that after 2 phone calls went unreturned, the company did respond to an email and did agreeably refund my money."
1840,0,"Do not buy from his publisher: Unbelievably poor quality edition:No ISBN number anywhere in the bookNo name of the translator anywhere in the bookPoor typesetting, lots of mistakes.Will never buy anything published by this ""publisher""."
1841,0,"Book is great-this translation is inadequate!: I love Bulgakov. I know the Master and Margarita by heart. And I was dismally disappointed in my anticipations of usual delights interacting with this book. I write interacting, because this book is more then just reading material. But back to the translation. It has missing passages, whole paragraphs, it uses wrong terms and notions. I had to return my copy. I expect to have more luck with RICHARD PEVEAR AND LARISSA VOLOKHONSKY translation published in PENGUIN BOOKS 1997, since I pre-viewd it one of the on-line libraries."
1842,0,"BUY A DIFFERENT EDITION!: As a few other reviewers have said, this edition (Classic House Books, paperback) is horrible. The Master and Margarita is one of my favorite books. I purchase a new copy and re-read it every few years. I purchase a new copy each time, because when I'm done I pass the book on to someone who's never read it. I decided I was due for a re-read, so I bought this. I wish I hadn't, because I'm not even going to be able to read it. The typos, byzantine punctuation and formatting are way too irritating. This book deserves to be enjoyed unreservedly.Please, read the book, if you haven't. But buy a different edition -- preferably the Mirra Ginsburg translation."
1843,0,"Great book, poor translation: The Master and Margarita is indeed one of the best written books ever. Unfortunately Glenny's translation leaves much to be desired. It reflects none of Bulgakov's witty, quirky, beautifully flowing style, and reads more like a verbatim translation of a theological treatise."
1844,0,"The middle path...: I am taking the middle path with my view that while the book possesses some poignant prose, it\'s essential message is one of antiChristianity. As a practicing Theravada Buddhist (who, unlike others, knows enough not to say ""God bless"" when pure Buddhists have no god) I must say I was taken aback by the antiGospel presented in the tale of Pontius Pilate. Pilate is a fascinating character. Yeshua, on the other hand, is presented as quite the opposite of his Jesus of the Gospel counterpart; Yeshua is fearful to the point of cowardice, bumbling and idiotic, he dies violently, does NOT rise (key difference with the Gospel, that any fool with the most remedial knowledge of the Gospel would know), and ends up a corpse buried with other common criminals. How this can substitute for the Gospel, how this shows Jesus coming off fine is WAY beyond me. This is an antiGospel. Those who are not Christian wont be offended. The book is fine fiction, but not to be taken seriously."
1845,0,"creepy, dark, blasphemous book: If you want to feel creepy, weird, dark and half-way insane, please read this book - it's perfect for that. I also thought it was blasphemous."
1846,0,"God, evil is boring!: Unequivocally a heap of putrid, sickening tripe...a collection of overrated, overwritten, underimaginative, repetative fatuousness. Bulgakov is the complete antithesis of Russian greats like Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Nabakov. Bulgakov's characters are predictable, his plots uninteresting, his descriptions jejune and redundant. If I could I would give it zero stars. Waste of time!"
1847,0,"Poor Syntax, Spelling, and Lack of a Translator: I would be careful purchasing this edition of The Master and Margarita. The lack of a translator was apparent with misspelled words (haze, spelled ha2e), poor sentence structure (often lacking a verb), and the spacing was not indicative of who was speaking.I have since gone on and purchased the edition by Picador and find it an entrancing read. I realize now how much I missed out of the first three chapter of the edition I purchased from Amazon by Classic House Publishing."
1848,0,"Do not buy this version of M & M: The Master and Margarita is a wonderful book, a masterpiece, but this version is so flawed that it\'s hard to see the jewel underneath.I bought this copy because I\'d lost my last, almost worn out paperback. It is so full of typographical errors that it is nearly unreadable. Spelling mistakes, no spaces after punctuation, too many spaces after punctuation, odd use of conventions (quotation marks, colons, etc) make this apparently slickly produced book (nice cover photo, by the way) appear to be the work of a first year keyboarding student without any proofreading abilities.The errors are so numerous (many per EVERY paragraph) and so distracting that I am unsure whether I can finish the book before I chuck it in the recycling bin. I hope I can give it zero stars. If I have to select ""one star,"" believe me, it doesn\'t deserve it."
1849,0,"Bad batch or poor editing...: My Russian husband bought this book for me because he had researched and decided this was the best translation. While this may be the case (I don\'t know about that), the typos in this book are ridiculous! It is literally hard to get beyond the first chapter because of them. Excerpt complete with typos as seen in the book: ""As to his teeth, he haid platinum crowns on his left side and gold ones on his tight. [...] Right eye black, left ieye for some reason green."" I admit that I am particularly sensitive to this kind of thing, and I understand one or two errors getting by an editor, but this book is riddled with them and it makes it difficult to read, at least for me since every typo is like a hiccup in the flow of a sentence."
1850,0,"A lousy edition of a great book: I bought this book because I had worn out a previous copy from several re-readings. Needless to say, the book is worth reading, but I strongly suggest obtaining a different edition from this one. The production quality of this book is zero! Multiple typos in just the first 5 pages, a clumsy typeface, sloppy spacing -- obviously somebody just printed out a poorly produced text document that had never been proofread. I have given the book to a resale shop because it was so bad that I couldn't stand to read it."
1851,0,"bootleg edition: Do not purchase this book published under ISBN 1442133171. It is a scanned and poorly OCR\'d copy of another translation. The bootleggers didn\'t even proofread this before ""publishing"" the scanned edition via CreateSpace. So many typos, the letter z is often swapped with the number 2, etc. Don\'t get me started on punctuation, esp. pertaining to dialogue. DO NOT BUY!"
1852,0,"Appalling!: This edition of a Russian classic is probably illegally produced. It contains no original copyright dates, no names of translators, no introduction or notes. It is appalling that this is the edition that comes up first on an Amazon search. It also contains innumerable typos, bizarre spacing, and is generally unreadable. As it happens, this is a very difficult book even in a good edition, such as Penguin Classics, so a bad edition causes the reader unnnecessary anguish. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1853,0,"Terrible packing and service.: Sure, I recieved the right poster. However when it came not only was the packaging TERRIBLE but it was bent everywhere and even torn in some places. That is $7 I will never get back. Thoroughly disappointed with this product and recommend to anyone reading this to not use this poster carrier or maybe even not to purchase posters from amazon. EXTREMELY disappointed."
1854,0,False Advertising: I ordered this poster before Christmas.I received a different poster than what I ordered a week after Christmas.When I contacted Adam Hersch I was told the poster was no longer available.After I left a negative comment on Amazon about this company they started contacting me to see what they could do to resolve the issue.They ended up offering me two other posters of my choice and asked me to remove my comments.I should have waited because I have not seen the other posters and get the run around when I contact them.Poor service.Will NEVER use them again.They are advertising this poster new but told me they could not get it.
1855,0,Boring & Predictable !!: IRREGARDLESS Of MURDER was a predictable mystery which made this book a chore to get through. I will not be buying any more books by Ellen Edwards Kennedy any time soon !!
1856,0,"Good movie, horrible DVD transfer: While this is a good movie, it is a horrible DVD transfer. It skips and jumps. Wait for a better transfer."
1857,0,"Is it ""Alpha"" or ""Image"" ?????: I really want to get this movie, but am a bit confused as to which version I will get.I have the IMAGE copy bookmarked, but when I got to review details it shows the cover of the Alpha copy !!ALPHA is notorious for putting out the worst pieces of Chit on DVD.How is the Image version ?????"
1858,0,a ripoff: Item is a DVD copy from another source...sound trails image by a few seconds THROUGHOUT....do NOT buy this DVD it is worthless
1859,0,"Disappointed: I thought I was getting a good price for a great film. However, the digital transfer was horrible - which is probably why I got a bargain price. I would not recommend this film copy, nor will I purchase anything else from this company. What I learned from this purchase is always read the low rated reviews. Also, shop to see if there is a remastered edition - which there is."
1860,0,"Detour ...: I am a great admirer of ""Detour"" which is probably the best low-budget film noir ever made. But this DVD is a piece of junk. It is transferred from a lousy, battered 35mm print that has badly spliced gaps and screwed-up film footage in crucial scenes, obliterating some of the best dialogue. The company that put this out should be ashamed of itself, especially considering this film is now considered a low-budget masterpiece. If you have no copy of this, get the Sinister Cinema VHS. It is a much higher quality print."
1861,0,"Take a detour away from this DVD: I wasn\'t all that impressed with this movie, finding it too self-consciously ""noir-ish"" for its own good. But you know something? I\'m going to give it another chance sometime in the future, as I can\'t help but feel that the reprehensible shape of the print used to make this DVD contributed to my lack of enjoyment of the story. In fact, it\'s like I haven\'t even SEEN the whole movie, as entire lines of dialogue were missing every few minutes, accompanied by horrible splices. Trust me, stay away form this particular DVD and wait for someone to release a print of it that\'s at least watchable."
1862,0,Poor Quality: Fat Daddio's 8 Inch x 3 Inch Stainless Steel Cake and Pastry Ring: I ordered this product on two separate occasions and both times it was received defective. The 8 Inch x 3 Inch product was not perfectly round. On a good note... Smaller Fat Daddio rings like the 8 Inch x 2 Inch were received in perfect condition.
1863,0,"Recieved Warped Twice: When I received this product, it arrived warped and useless. I re-ordered it, and it again arrived warped and useless. My only suggestion to those who would like this product is to order it with a number of other cake rings. Maybe if they come together, they will protect themselves."
1864,0,"Not round, more of an oval: When I got this ring, the first thing I noticed right away was that it was not round. It had a flattened side and it was unusable. It also had some minor scratches."
1865,0,"Anti-mormon literature takes a new form: A surprising book because it takes anti-mormon literature into a new form: the novel. I was greatly distressed that Bethanyhouse would publish such a blantently anti-mormon work. The book deals with a inquisitive young girl named Jenny who becomes attracted to Mormonism. The book depicts Joseph Smith as a lewd, lazy, money-digging bad guy, who used the people to get power for himself. It is a very nasty bit of fiction."
1866,0,A very big disappointment: This is a great book however the problem lies with in ther traanslation. the problem is that only 300 of the 1300 phrases were translated. Although this translation gives the basic message that Master Tsunetomo was trying to get a cross you can not truly absorb thius book with out reading everything that Master Tsunetomo intended you to read. Also the entire 5th chapter is left out of this translation. I would recomend to everyone to find a better translation than this one.
1867,0,"Not worth the money!: Not worth the money do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more on a better built cabinet. It was difficult to put together and broke the first time it was opened, it's just very flimsy and poorly made. I would not recommend buying this shoe storage cabinet to anyone. Stay Away!!"
1868,0,"Very confusing: I bought this mouse, and was able to configure it to my PC... up to a point. Many of the special functions of the mouse I could not figure out. In addition, the basic mouse function sometimes worked... other times did not. The ""instruction manual"" that came with the product was horrible. And ""customer service"" at the manufacture? Also horrible. I called them and the phone rang off the hook. Sent them an email and they replied three days later by email indicating that I should call them, but at that time, I did not have the device with me at the office so that I could review with them step by step how to get the device to work. So I would have had to bring the device back into the office the next day and spend time during my workday trying to call them. (Naturally, their ""customer service"" hours were only M-F, 9-5 or something like that.) I felt that the company just didn\'t ""care""."
1869,0,"This movie ...[is] so bad, I am thinking about buying it.: Me and my wife saw this movie when it was new (89). We read the cover on the back and decided to save the best till last.We struggled through the first 30 minutes, but antipated that it would get better. Another 15 minutes... Now we\'re struggling.I can literally say that when someone asks, ""What is the worst movie you have ever seen?"". Hands down, ""Quarantine"".However, I am thinking about purchasing it, only to have proof.One more thing. I wanted to give it no stars, until I found out that it is not possible. Therefore, I give a star to the cover."
1870,0,"This product is a fire hazard: I purchased this charger for my husband in June 2011. He used it once and it worked fine. He used it again two months later in August, and it started smoking when plugged in! He moved it to a different outlet and again it started smoking and he could smell it burning. I'm just glad that he didn't plug it in in the basement and leave it there - it could have burned our house down.Do not put your family at risk with this product! Unfortunately I only had 1 month to return it and I didn't know that it was defective until I'd had it for 2 months, so I'm out $20."

1873,0,This item was returned.: The correct battery charger was sent in it's place and received. It is an excellent product. The charger that replaced it was the correct 18v charger and was also an excellent product.
1874,0,Never again: Bought this charger to replace original charger that burned up after a few uses. Used this to charge 2 batteries and now this new charger is burned up also. Guess I should have read the reviews before buying. Buyer beware.

Was phyched because I've been without a charger for awhile, plugged in and started charging. Started gettin hot (like the original carger) didn't think much of it. Then noticed the charger slowly melting above the red charge light. Then poof!! Fire! This thing is garbage!! I strongly advise not buying. Goto black n decker if anything. I'm taking it and buying a new drill unfortunatly. Its crap!!!!"
1879,0,Junk: A piece of junk.The first one was DOA and was replaced.The replacement worked but got so hot I was afraid to use it and it may have damaged my battery.The cost of a new battery and a good charger is more than the cost of a new drill.I have bought my last piece of Black & Decker.
1880,0,"Broke after one week: This item was plugged in to charge my drill batteries. After one week, it stopped working and batteries do not charge. I didn't bother to return the item because of its relatively low cost, but be cautious about buying this item."
1881,0,"Worked for a year and a half, then died, but I was rough with it & left it plugged in too long: I was very happy with the drill (and this charger), but after nearly a couple years the charger stopped working. I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT A DYING/FAULTY BATTERY CAN FRY THE CHARGER, and you should never leave it charging more than 3 hours. I did not follow this rule.Granted, I kept the charger in a tool crate rattling around with big tools, and it's not the sturdiest thing. A wire connection could have been bent. I'm gonna disassemble it and see if I can fix it.So go ahead and buy it, but be aware it's kind of delicate. The rest of the drills/batteries are fine and sturdy. 2011 EDIT: I MUCH MORE RECOMMEND B&D;'S SMART CHARGER WHICH TELLS YOU WHEN THE BATTERY IS FAULTY AND DOES A COMPLETE CHARGE IN 1.5 HOURS, AND WON'T COOK THE BATTERY. SAME PRICE."
1882,0,"Black and Decker battery charger: My battery charger worked for about a week and then quit working. Since it doesn't work on either battery, I have to assume the charger is bad rather than both batteries being bad."
1883,0,B&D 12 volt battery charger: Worked for about 4 weeks and then died. Would have expected better life from a product advertised as new. Review forces you to rate at least one star. This one deserves zero stars.
1884,0,WORTHLESS--BURNED UP IMMEDIATELY: This charger burned up within a few hours of plugging it in.Someone must knowingly be selling this defective product.I suspect I am not the first victim.
1885,0,Thank God they discontinued this item: This always was a cheap piece of junk from Black & Decker. The new multi-volt charger is much better as you can leave the battery on the charger in case you forget it. It took so long to charge a battery where as the newer model will do so in one hour. This never should have been put on the market.
1886,0,"It blow out the first time I used it: This was my second battery charger for this drill and I have had enough. When I tested my battery with my volt meter it tested okay so I started charging it about fifteen minutes later ""pop"" now the charger is dead. I bought an electric drill, and said forget it."
1887,0,10 mm thickHugger Mugger mat purchase a mistake!: I have been practicing Yoga for many years. One gal that practices with me loves this mat. Because I needed a new one I inquired and bought one. IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE...$75!!! Doing a headstand and shoulder stand on this thick mat is like doing these on a bed mattress. My neck is now so messed up I will be lucky to be able to ever do these poses again... My chiropractor is needed weekly and I still need a new mat. Don't buy this product for an advanced Yoga practice!!!!
1888,0,"breaks down after a year: When I first bought this mat I loved it. After a year of use the mat started to shrink in spots and buckle. It has become so bad that I had to abandon it because it would not flatten out and it became difficult to execute balancing poses. I contacted the company explaining the situation and sent a picture. They told me that the mat was designed to be biodegradable and would break down under some conditions and environments. If you expect your yoga mat to last, then look at other products."
1889,0,"not worth the money: The rubber that this mat is made of is just too soft. I practice hot room power yoga and sure this mat is non slip, but my hands and legs sink into the mat and stretch the mat out. Makes me feel like I am practicing yoga on a piece of cotton fabric."
1890,0,"Nice texture, bad smell: I was so excited to receive the mat. It looks really nice and has a nice texture. I like the length of it being a few inches more than the standard size. I can't wait to use it. But little did I know, it has a very strong yucky smell, in some way worse standard yoga mats. I washed it with soap and water and laid it flat in the garage to air it out. It's been three days, the smell seems to fade a little but it's still not usable. My other yoga mats took only a couple of days for the smell to fade away.Update:It's been more than a month since I received the mat. It still has that light rubbery smell. I had it out in the sun several times but I can't seem to get rid of the smell. Other than that, I do like the mat. It has a nice texture and provides good traction."
1891,0,"Don't waste your money.....: I purchased this Hugger Mugger mat based on the reviews above....big mistake. I attend yoga classes 2-3 times a week, so I have had a chance to so through a number of mat's in 4+ years. I gave this mat about 2 months before I decided to submit a review. I don't see ANY redeeming quality about this mat...NONE. Not only is it not durable, but if you get even a slight amount of moisture on the palms of your hand, and you will slip all over this mat. Remember the 'slip and slide' mats when you were a kid?? I think this yoga mat is made of the same material. Stay away at all cost....."
1892,0,SUPER ANTI SLIPPERY: This mat is SO anti-slippery you'll have so much trouble fitting it into the Hugger Mugger yoga mat bags.
1893,0,Hugger Bummer: I purchased this mat less than a month ago and when I went to unroll it the 3rd time for class the ribbing on the mat had disappeared on the upper portion of the mat where my hands would be placed! I didn't do anything unusual to cause the morphing. I am in the process of returning it.
1894,0,"Not very durable: This mat lasted me for less than a year. At first, I loved it. It was sticky and had nice cushioning. Under moderate use, it started peeling. It also lost its stickiness very quickly. I'm very disappointed in it as Hugger Mugger usually makes excellent yoga products."
1895,0,"Undecided: When I bought this mat a couple years ago, I was looking for a longer mat. I\'d find my nose or toes hanging off one end or the other of my standard-size mat (I\'m 5\'10""). The lack of PVC and the somewhat Earth-friendly material led me to this mat rather than other longer mats.Early-on, the mat was both too sticky and too slippery. The slightest moisture made it slippery, and it is sticky when dry. Two or three times I stubbed my big toe in a big, painful way going from down dog to lunge. I do have a certain amount of excess girth that gets in the way of some maneuvers but I never stubbed my toe while using my first PVC mat. My leader thinks the mat is too sticky. The slipperiness was gone after a month or two.I practiced twice a week for much of the past two years but practice only sporadically now. There are some cracks but no tears or gouges. I would not buy this mat again."
1896,0,Skin Art: I thought this was a very poorly written movie; it could have and should have been a lot better. The acting was also poor.
1897,0,"Nothing but lies, hatred and hearsay = F-: Where are the facts? James Ennes bases the entire book on his alleged encounter at a coffee machine with another Liberty officer in 1974. This man claimed to have been at a Pentagon meeting with Admiral David L. McDonald. In this meeting he claims that William Fulbright stated that Pres. Lyndon Johnson told him that he believed the attack was deliberate.When interviewed by A. JAy Cristol, Senator Fulbright confirmed that he and Johnson weren\'t on good terms at the time and weren\'t even talking. McDonald, chief of Naval Operations in 1967 was also interviewed and he ""had no recollection of any such conversation with Fulbright. In short Ennes makes claims that are NOT verifiable and this proves the sloppy journalism that this book, Assault on the Liberty, is guilty of.There are many books on this subject that are backed up by facts and evidence, read one of those instead of the book above that is based simply on hearsay and revenge fantasies."
1898,0,A stirring bit of fiction: Ennes one-man crusade against the Jewish faith has been going on for decades and has culminated in this piece of fiction. Innuendo and speculation replaces verifiable facts and sworn testimony.
1899,0,"This shoyuld be in the Fiction section: Once again fiction is called fact! the only thing this book does is to try and inflame a hatred for Israel and Jews worldwide.The Facts are there but Ennes refuses to look at them.I\'m appaled that what he calls fact is nothing more then refuted lies.Change the title to :""Lies and how they made me rich""Most of the people praising this book are the USENET whackjobs who post this thing daily in Jewish/Israeli Newsgroups and NEVER ever do they read the facts. Ennes has once again given the Tin Foil gang something to roll in while to the rest of the world it is a waste of good trees"
1900,0,"Not worth reading: This book is full of factual errors. If you read this work of fiction you will not learn, you will just be misinformed. I recommend that you do not waste your time or money on this book."
1901,0,"No a good book, and used for a horrible class: The seller shipped it quick that was great, but the book it self is not for me. If you already have a basic knowledge and an extensive vocabulary. You may enjoy this."
1902,0,"very bad movie: Too much profanity, too much bad dialog, and a poor plot all combine for one lousy movie.Chuck norris is a cop who is double crossed by his partner. He ends up being sent undercover to bust the mob who is in life and death battle with Iranian hit men. Turns out the Iranians are working for his old partner who tried to kill him at the beggining of the movie.Every other word in this movie starts with an F and ends wtih K and the action/fight scenes are very poor.I'd stay away from this movie at all costs.Rich"
1903,0,do not buy if you have windows 7 with a 64 bit processor: it does not even load on my 64 bit windows seven computer I am going to try to load a second xp program but i do not have much hope for this program it is and excellent program i have used on other computer in the past and I love when it works but not if i can not get it downloaded.
1904,0,"Ugh: I can't understand how anyone can like this movie. I dunno, maybe I've been spoiled by Toy Story and the like, but this movie was simply not good. The musical numbers reeked and the characters were annoying, especially the whiney blonde chick who looked like she was half asleep most of the time and that bimbo of a nutcracker with that idiot grin of his. There's no way I'd pay $1 for this movie, let alone $14."
1905,0,"Disappointing: I ordered this videobased upon the trailer on the Muppets From Space video. What a disappointment! The animation is mediocre and the plot doesn't make any sense. I do not recommend this video; there are many children's videos which are far more interesting, creative and funny. Spend your money on them."
1906,0,"looks good: judging from all the fruit on the cover, i'd have to give this movie a high rating...FIVE STARS, YOU MORONS!"
1907,0,"Why the religious references, this isn't Veggie Tales: I loved the humor, and the Rat, err, Mouse King's antics, but what I couldn't stand was the religous stuff. It's not advertised on the front, and it's not mentioned in any of the reviews i read on this, or even in the preview trailer. It kind of bugs me to have this great christmas classic tarnished everytime Peabo Bryson decides to sing us a song. In every scene that accompanied his songs, it seemed like Marie and the gang were in church. I actually had to watch it again to make sure i wasn't imaging them. Now if I wanted VeggieTales, I'd buy it. Other than that, it's a goofy movie that keeps my kids plenty entertained."
1908,0,"Maybe if it was 22min but painful at 48min...: Younger children may enojy nuts talking and mice fighting the soldiers but all of this comes in way too long at 48min. I initially thought the Amazon Editorial Review by Doug Thomas was alittle harse but after watching this, it was kind. It may have had some chance at 22min (think of your favorite Christmas Special - most are for a 30min time slot - with the Rudolph classic set for 1hr). I knew Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and this is no Rudolph!"
1909,0,This movie stinks.: The so-called computer animation is terrible at best and the story line makes absolutley no sense. It's quite obvious that any positive review mention online here were from the film makers.
1910,0,"q tip at his worst: this is the epitome of falling off - the lyrics are wack (pretty girl, real good girl ... my itty bitty world) - the beat is silly - i dont know what happend to tip - he's been my hero since way back, but the old tip woiuld have agreed - this song is just plain sad"
1911,0,"Hmmm....Nope, Not Feeling It: ""Vivrant Thing"" was a big disappointment for me. I love A Tribe Called Quest and hearing Tip resort to this just tore me apart. Tip\'s lyrics are way too simplistic and trite and the beat is somewhat catchy, but annoying. I got Amplified and turned this up loud to see if I\'d get up and dance, but no. It didn\'t do anything for me. Maybe if he came with better lyrics and added something to the beat, ""Vivrant Thing would have been fine. I hope Tip will come with better material in the future."
1912,0,"A FABLE by William Faulkner: I read where Faulkner is sometimes referred to as the American Shakespeare. After reading A Fable, that is true if you want to use Shakespeare\'s ""Much Ado about Nothing"" to describe Faulkner\'s Pultizer Prize winning book. Who really needs a 600 + sentence while his stream of consciousness writing results in the reader becoming unconscious. The last 100 pages of the book wasn\'t bad, but it is hard to believe that it won the Pultizer. Earl Holden"
1913,0,"A reader's defeat: As the past reviewer I did not arrive to the page with THE END printed on it, and I really hate to be unable to finish a book. Anecdote aside, I am aware that my review lacks proper grounds, but since there is so much to read and too little time, I strongly suggest you to look for other works of this author. During the first chapter I seems to be going great, the drama was cleaver and catchy. But suddenly in the second chapter it just stops and all the events seem to be going nowhere. Besides the construction of the language is boring and confusing. It feels like the author worked in this novel for a while, then left it during some years locked in a closet and one fine day decided to complete it, but without being at ease doing so."
1914,0,"Did Faulkner care?: I had to read and re-read numerous sections of this book hoping to understand what Faulkner was getting at with this story and sadly, I never did get it. I knew that this was going to be a difficult book but not to the point that it discourages a person to never want to pick up another book. Faulkner's language and structure was not beautiful but forced and didn't seem to come natural like it had for me in his other works. There were times when I was reading when I thought that Faulkner was enjoying himself ramble aboout a non-sensical detail that left me frustrated and wanting to put the book down for good, but I carried on and finished the book.The book had its moments but not enough of them to make a clear and understandable story for me. Read at your own risk of being completely disappointed with Faulkner's A Fable."
1915,0,"A Turgid, Pretentious Anti-War Allegory: No wonder there is so little said about this award-winning Faulkner work. It is a chore to read. Only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story. Worse than that, the characters are like Rorschak blots with the Christian mythology mixed in. Stick with Faulkner's southern writings for characters who remain in your memory and images that are profound."
1916,0,"This is not an anti-war novel...: ... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics."
1917,0,"Faulkner 1, Reader 0: I generally like and admire Faulkner\'s work, but this novel (or whatever it is) got the better of me. Usually I make myself finish any book I read no matter how difficult, but with ""A Fable"" I simply couldn\'t do it (and I\'ve managed the entirety of James Joyce\'s ""Ulysses"" and Proust\'s ""Remembrance of Things Past"".) I may have a Master\'s Degree in English, but I still had great trouble following what was going on in the book, much less appreciating what it was trying to say. It\'s amazing to me that the Pulitzer Prize committee could even manage to get through this thing, much less give it an award. I haven\'t given up on Faulkner, but for the first time since I was a college undergraduate, I\'ve given up on a book. It took ""A Fable"" to bring me to my knees."
1918,0,This is Book is Hard: I can tell you this is probablt the hardest book you'll ever read. Its uses differrent language that you cannot understand. The boy Jethro talks so wierd my mom couldnt even understand. If you have this book as a book report tell the teacher everyone who read it told you it was hard because it really is. I have a Civil War book report due and I picked this book because my brother read it but he's some kind of genius. So I hope this will help you to pick another book.Unless your in Middle School or 8th Grade this book is way to hard unless your some kind of genius.

1922,0,"Possible solution for dropped connections: I had both the whole unit stop working and the strange wireless connection freezes. I have this gateway and the solution to the dropped connections and lock ups was to put a very small fan blowing on the router. It's possible that it's an overheating problem, even when the room is relatively cool. I read about the possible overheating problem somewhere, and my connection has been completely solid 24/7 for several months since I put the fan on it. Before that, it was dropping the connection daily and required pulling the power plug to reset the connection.This product was given to me by Comcast when I ordered the Home Networking option.The connection IS much better now with this modem than it was before with my own store-bought cable modem, but that is not saying much.In summary: This unit sucks, don't buy it - and I like Netgear products.If this review helps you with your problem, please bump it (click on 'Yes' it was helpful)"
1923,0,"Terrible Tech Support: This cable modem and wireless functions of this device seemed to be operational, but any time I tried to have two computers hooked up simultaneously, both computers would lose their connection with the gateway. This was indeed frustrating, but technical support failed to resolve the problem after a month of exasperating phone calls and one product exchange. I was twice promised a return call within 24 hours, and twice unapologetically snubbed.I have been extremely disappointed and discouraged with this experience, and I am not inclined to ever purchase another Netgear product. I have returned this product and decided to go with Linksys after a recommendation from my systems administrator."
1924,0,"Same problems as previous review: I have had this router/gateway for the past year.Since then, it has basically stopped working for any kind of long transfer between two wireless devices (i.e. more than 50Mb sustained.) The router will completely crash; while the lights still flash, 802.11b and 10Base-T connections do not transit data.I called their customer support line and was treated extremely rudely. They basically said it was my problem and too bad.I will never buy another Netgear product again. A shame, as they used to have much better hardware and support (then again, this was back in 1999...)"
1925,0,"Long term failure: I've had this product for a little over a year now, and I'm about to toss it and move a to a Linksys.Over the life of the unit it has had occasional Internet drop outs that would require the unit to be powered off and on to recover. This happened infrequent enough to be a small nuisance that didn't rise to the level of replacement.Unfortunately recently the wireless of router has been dropping and then last week completely failed. Of course being out of warrantee, no support is offered.My guess as to the failure is that the unit simply runs too hot. Not enough engineering and too much in too little of a package. You could use it as coffee warmer.The reviews on the Linksys WCG200 look good and I'm braving the Comcast tech support tonight."
1926,0,"Netgear CG814M and Comacst: My 3 star rating is based on my rating of this unit's features and Netgear support - I still do not have it working yet.(I have made 6 calls to Comcast support, but the connection from the modem is still being refused by Comcast.)I called Netgear support to see if they could shed any light, and after waiting 45 minutes, was answered by a call center in India by a technician that I could not understand. An e-mail supprt request remains unanswered after 2 days."
1927,0,"Repeatedly Drops Connection: I have the same problem as several other reviewers. The box repeatedly drops the wireless connection and has to be rebooted. I'm actually on my third one, the first two having been replaced by Netgear after the same problem. Reviewers who love it tend to be those who just set it up. Setup was easy and the unit worked beautifully in the beginning but as another reviewer said, it seems to run too hot and just wears itself out. The drops initially only happened every few days, now a few times a day and any time I attempt to move a large amount of data. Alas, will have to replace the unit again."
1928,0,"Poor quality: I do not normally write reviews, however, the product I ordered, the organic burp cloths, was not the item I received. Although I should contact the seller, the item I received, which was a pack of 2 organic round bibs (smaller than normal bibs, primarily for drool and spit-up), was okay AND I'm 9 1/2 months pregnant and don't have the time or energy to deal with returning something that I can use. However, buyers beware, the item I ordered was not the item I received, and although I haven't used or washed the cotton mini-bibs yet, the are not the best of quality. My thought was, organic would be nice, but they seem very cheaply made. We will see. Either way, not impressed and just wanted to give everyone else a heads up on this!"
1929,0,Fell apart after one washing: I never even got to use these. I washed them once time while I was getting things ready for the baby. One of the washcloths completely fell apart. I plan to contact the manufacturer and Amazon.
1930,0,"Got small bibs instead of burp cloths: I ordered these burp cloths, but instead got 2 very small bibs (the ones that just go around the baby's neck)."
1931,0,"...organic?: I was not pleased with this product. First of all, they're made in China. Can something made where 90% of the ground water is contaminated with pollution really be considered organic? Secondly, after only one washing -- before even being used -- the quality was seriously degraded. They are cheaper than other organic burp cloths, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1932,0,"Over priced wash cloth: These are not nearly as soft and absorbent as I had hoped. Also, there are many loose threads and the quality is not at all what I expected. I say save your money for another product. My favorite burp clothes are the Babies R Us brand."
1933,0,"NOT FOR AMERICAN GIRL DOLLS!!!!!!: My daughters used their own money to purchase outfits for their brand new American Girl Dolls, and we sadly had to return them since they DO NOT fit AG dolls!!Don't waste your $$$ or time buying these outfits, you'll only end up with a sad little girl, and yet another errand to run."
1934,0,"Superficial to an extreme: There is a crying need for new histories of the Cold War based on revelations, especially from Soviet sources, but also from declassified American material released since the end of the period. This is not it. Covering the 40+ years in less than 300 pages implies some superficiality, but Gaddis\' approach makes the effort essentially worthless. He also has to take the obligatory slap at McCarthy without bothering to admit that ""we now know"" (the title of another Gaddis work) that declassified material has largely shown that he told the truth and his detractors consistently lied. He then digresses into a ludricrous analysis of nuclear strategy that coincides with no known theory. He has dumbed the entire process down to a horrible degree and the entire enterprise is awash in political correctness."
1935,0,"The Cold War, A New History: I received the book and it appeared to be in good order. Not until I was far into the book did I realize it was missing over 30 pages. I didn't realize one needed to count the pages in a book to make sure they were all there."
1936,0,"Not what I expected: This is a well written book that unfortunately is not the book I hoped it would be. If, like me, you are looking for a book that retells the history and events of the cold war then you will be disappointed. If you already possess a knowledge or vivid memory of those events and are looking for an opinion on the thoughts of individuals and the ideology that led to those events then you will be delighted. For example, I would expect a book on the Cold War to spend 10+ pages on the Berlin airlift. There was one sentence that mentioned it occurred. Checkpoint Charlie and the stories associated with it - not mentioned. Gary Powers and the U2 plane - one paragraph. Etc. Etc. Again, this is a well written book and the author didn't fail to deliver so much as I failed to buy the right book. I offer this review so that others looking for the same book I was aren't disappointed."
1937,0,"At least they got back together...: Jon Hiseman writes in the booklet: ""If you are looking for <<Son of Valentyne Suite>> you can forget it... those days are long gone, for us, as well as you..."" No kidding! If you loved the rock-jazz of the 70s Colosseum with those trademark fugues you will hate this CD. The sound reminds me of a watered down, boring mix of Blood Sweat and Tears, Steely Dan, and Chicago. Heckstall-Smith is vaguely decent only on a couple of tracks. Don\'t waste your money on this CD--buy the old ones. The rating is *two* stars instead of one (or zero) as an encouragement to stay together and rediscover their rock-jazz plus classical roots."
1938,0,"Out of Stock: After placing the order and receiving the package, I received the wrong products. I was told this product was out of stock when I called Amazon. They sent me two of the 1-Tea light holders instead. To be honest, I think they were accidently put the 1-Tea light holders in the box, but they wouldn't admit that. It didn't SAY they were out of stock online. Someone just wasn't paying attention to what they were packing. But WHY would you send a different size of the production in its place IF the one you ordered is out of stock?! Doesn't make any sense to me...They just wouldn't admit to it. However, I got a refund for the products."
1939,0,"Crashes before it sails: 2 1/2Atmosphere defeats substance in middling late seventies fusion, which at best evokes a mild Miles."
1940,0,"No Footnotes!: This edition of Freud had NO FOOTNOTES! How can any publisher take pride in itself, when it removes the such an essential element to from the text? This is shameful."
1941,0,Buy a newer one.: This wouldn't be bad if it were done within the last ten years but it's so hopelessly out of date now that you're better off buying something more recent.
1942,0,"?: I bought this years ago, and it wasn't bad then. Wouldn't buy it now though. Of course there's not much here about Cape Cod."
1943,0,crappy valves: For some reason these valves are too big for my pump. It is the right model and everything. Totally bummed.
1944,0,"Shipping is outrageous!: Shipping is outrageous!sure your prices look the best but the shipping is highway robbery!How dare you charge more for shipping then the item it's self, and more than you indicated!the seller is a liar!"
1945,0,"Disappointing: This is one of the most disappointing book of short stories I have read in a long time. The characters are shallow, boring and forgettable. The book has a section called ""Three Stories"", describing different times in the lives of the same characters. The character development, however, was so shallow, that I didn\'t realize I was reading about the same people until I noticed that I was seeing the same (unusual) name, Galen, so many times. Ms. Bloom tries to add surprises to each story. Since I couldn\'t identify or empathize with the characters, the surprises were just an author trying to add oomph to an otherwise dull story."
1946,0,"Dull and dry: A very dull and dry book. Not engaging in the descriptions of the actions or events. A book with maps and simple listing of the dates and actions would have been far more entertaining and informational.Had a really hard time trying to read this book. Infantry and Panzer Aces by Kurowski, both provide better detail and information on the fighting on the Eastern Front. An even better book on the upper command situation in WW2 is Panzer Battles, by von Mellenthin.Recommendation, borrow it from the library instead if you really want to read it. You are not missing anything."
1947,0,"Thought it would be better....Look at Something Else!: Fighting In Hell at some pionts was like ""Reading In ****"" The book is on Personal passages of four German Commanders in the Eastern Front. For someone doing a school report on this subject, the book would have some good info. At some points in the book it is suggested what to wear in really cold weather, etc., For the average reader (like myself) looking for a good read with action, this is not the book. I did learn some new things that I was not aware of previously however, I could not wait to finish this book, it was boring and too long. I\'m glad it was only a seven dollar book! I would not buy this book again!!!"
1948,0,"Too colorless and artless for me: This is strictly a batch of poorly written first-hand reports without appropriate annotation. There are interesting anecdotes about the fierce cold and the toll it took, but this simply wasn't a well-done book. Disappointing"
1949,0,"Don\'t waste your time!: I consider myself to be a ""serious"" history buff, and this book is not history! It\'s a boring rehash from behind the front German generals. What ordeals did they suffer compared to the troops on the line? This book was boring, stilted, and told me nothing I hadn\'t read elsewhere."
1950,0,"another boring flop: I continue in my quest to find a good book from German side that is fair about a such topic like East Front. When I say fair I mean not touched by Cold War's blinders :)Well... again a failure. I understand that the book was written using defeated German (or still Nazi :) ) Generals during the 50s, but.... NOWADAYS I'd like to read a book without the cliche about the Russian Winter, Asian menthality (this is a bit racistic IMHO) and so on.However, if you like books with a strong German bias, and continue to believe to German General's tales you can buy it. But remember here you don't find real insight"
1951,0,"Interesting for only the most hard-core WWII historian: An interesting premise for a WWII history book - this is a compilation of the writings of various German soldiers in Allied captivity who wrote about thier experiences on the Russian front - unfortunately most, if not all, of the personal experiences and anecdotes have been left out. It reads like a fairly dry battle manual, describing Russian tacticts, the 'personality' and leadership style of the Russians, etc. very little in the way of interesting anecdotes. This is a valuable piece of researh - useful for a historian doing specific research on tacticts on the Russian front, but is little more than a dry overview. If you are looking for an interesting narative, this is NOT it. If you are looking for battle tacticts and examinations of the russian way of combat - possibly as research material for a book or research paper, this may be for you, otherwise, you may want to avoid this."
1952,0,"Pretty terrible: This is one of those awful marketing scams. You know, you buy a book and find you have only a quarter of the story, you have to buy three more to find out what happened.This book, Death's Gray Land, is 90% padding and rubbish meanderings and about 10% of . . . no, I can't even say 10% of it is 'good'; it is all rubbish, in fact.The author has written what is really a civil war novel, about an imaginary civil war, with virtually no action; instead, just lots and lots of unneccessary description and meaningless dialogue. And then this has been called an SF novel! There's no science in it and little else of interest."
1953,0,"Carbon copy: I bought ""Black Halo"" at the prompting of my college-aged sons and loved it, so I went out and got Karma, Epica, and Fourth Legacy. All are carbon copies of Black Halo (I don\'t know which was released first, I\'m just going by when I got them). Since I can\'t return opened media, I\'ll make money off them at a yard sale. Really disappointed. But Roy Khan has a KILLER voice. LOVE to hear him sing, even if it is the same thing every time. Get Black Halo if you want to try this band. The first track on that CD is the best one of ALL their CD\'s."

I thought that the cheap price of these doorbells was a bargain, but you get what you pay for. When I first opened the boxes I was impressed with the nice wood covers. unfortunately the plastic stems that connect the grommets to the chime bar were broken off. I thought this might just be one bad apple of the bunch. But after opening the rest of the doorbells I found out that all four of them were defective and broken in the same spots. This was very frustrating since it wasted my time and money. I will not ever buy another product with the Broan name on it and I advise you not to either."
1958,0,"Too much work!: I am so disappointed in this book, what a waste of money. This is a direct quote from the book: ""Make observations, Dig deep! Think hard. This is not an easy passage. Spend time on this. Make dozens and dozens of observations. Read and read! Looik again! Observe! Observe! Observe!"" This quote is repeated in the first assignments. I am an avid reader of all kinds of books and I am old enough to know that hard work is necessary in many aspects of our lives, but surely this is not one of them. The bible is too complex even for educated theologians. I don\'t want to work that hard. The book is supposed to be ""hands on"". Maybe it gets better later in the book, but frankly, this author\'s writing style is not engaging at all, and I find it so laborious to read it, to the point where I just can\'t make myself read any further."

1961,0,"Sizing is inconsistent within this brand: I have 2 pairs of Tamarac slippers already, and when they went on sale, I decided to buy a couple of pairs for next year. I bought a size 9 previously in a different style and they fit perfectly. These are beautiful slippers, very well made, but when my second pair arrived, they were too tight and I have to send them back. Very unfortunate because I love the feel of these. I hope this manufacturer will correct these sizing inconsistencies so I can buy with confidence in the future."
1962,0,"You get what you pay for: $15.00 was best price ever for sheepskin slippers, but the inside seams stuck up all the way around, so not at all comfortable. Had to return. Got the Cabela's booties instead, lots more $ but much better quality."
1963,0,Poor fit: I had to return these because they were too narrow. I usually wear a 7.5 but read these run small so I got a 9. The length was right but my toes still felt squished because they were too narrow. I ended up finding a different brand and love those.
1964,0,"STINKY: I thought these slippers were a good value at first. Fit was not really a problem. They looked like quality slippers and the price was a fraction of similar looking ones. They kept my feet warm. But, that was many months ago. I can't believe that I am the only person to comment on the major defect of these slippers: the unbelievable stench. The bottom and part of the sides is constructed of some kind of plastic material. After a short time, maybe a month or so, the slipper develops an odor that is unbelievable. It's like rotting vegetation. I put charcoal odor eaters in and the stench chewed those babies up and spit them out. The stink is like no other foot stink I have ever encountered in my long and stinky life. Out of desperation I put them in the washing machine. They didn't fall apart, but the stink still lingers on, after washing and two rinses and going mostly through a drying cycle. Nothing can overpower the stink of these slippers. I'm throwing them away. I pity the garbage men."
1965,0,"Slippers Don't LAST!! Buy Cheap Ones!!: I really liked these when I got them in early January. Actually, $34.97 is a LOT for me to pay for slippers, but I bought them anyway, thinking they'd last! HAH! It's now one month later, and both heels have holes in them, and NO way, as far as I can see, to mend them.Next time I'll buy the old 'cheapies' from K-Mart or Walmart & pay $6.00.I'm REALLY disappointed!"
1966,0,"Not so comfy: I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, ""hey, they\'re cheap, isn\'t all shearling good?"" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy.They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I\'m a size 7, and the 8\'s were a little small for my feet."
1967,0,"Investigation revealed the problem: Another reviewer complained that seams caused discomfort. I carefully inspected mine and found that the sheepskin in the sole had been pieced together, sewn together so that there are ridges to be felt by the foot bottom. This is an absolute NO-NO in the manufacture of shoes. One does NOT utilize scraps of construction material in this manner. Someone needs to supervise this factory."
1968,0,"had to return this item: There was nothing wrong with these slippers other than they did not fit properly. Information had been provided that these slippers run small, and advice was given to order up a half size. I normally wear a 7 1/2, so i ordered the 8's. I could not keep them on my feet. They were very wide and too long. The quality was OK but they were such a poor fit, even with socks, that i just returned them."
1969,0,"Dissapointed: I bought these slippers when Amazon had them for less than $15, so I probably shouldn't complain, BUT... First, the size is quite small. I wear a 10 and ordered a 10 and an 11, based apon others reviews. The 11 BARELY fits, and I can feel my toes bumping against the ends of the slippers when I walk.As far as quality goes, the slippers do look nice, but unlike other similar slippers I've owned (and paid a lot more for) there is little to no cushioning inside the shoes. I'm not just referring to the cushioning between your feet and the floor, but between your feet and the seams where the sole is sewn onto the bottom. I can feel the pronounced ridges of the seams all the way around the bottom of my foot, and they make standing in the slippers for more than a moment or two quite painful. If the slippers were bigger, maybe I wouldn't feel it, but I finally had to put in a pair of insoles, which did help a bit. All in all, I'm pretty dissapointed."
1970,0,"Good quality, soft sole: I recently broke my foot, and got these slippers for recovery. Although they are good quality, the sole is soft and thin. A great buy if that's what you're looking for. Unfortunately, didn't work for me."
1971,0,"Disappointed: I bought the size I usually buy in a slipper, but the toe area is too tight and short. The heel is too loose. The bottoms are not cushioned, at all. Too bad they are nice looking."
1972,0,"sizing + rough + made in china = meh.: Odd sizing: I ordered a size too large based on other reviews, and they fell off my feet. I returned them for my usual size, and my toes bump the tips. Well, they\'re leather, they should slop out with wear. The sole is also disproportionately narrow.Rough shearling: nothing really horrible, but enough to be irritating over a long evening\'s wear.""Representing the finest in America\'s Slipper Tradition"" (That\'s what it says right on the box): my eye, they\'re made in China!Bottom line: my feet are warm, but these aren\'t worth the cost, especially when environmental factors are included. When they wear out, I\'ll be looking for local + quality to replace."
1973,0,"Editor Please!: The publisher created this book utilizing OCR software. There are multiple typos on every page, in some cases rendering words incomprehensible. This is explained by the publisher as a cost-containment measure. So everyone wins! What a joke. This particular book should never have been published. I wish I had gone elsewhere to read this wonderful play."
1974,0,"the paper is of very low quality: My daughter is very disappointed with this coloring book.The paper is very dark, ruff and thin. It absorbs the ink so fast, that it is almost impossible to color using markers, you can only use crayons.The price is high and the quality is low - not a good product.The Pictures are nice, though."
1975,0,"Biased: This book, while well-written, is fatally marred by the author\'s biases and selective view of the evidence. If you read the entire retrial testimony rather than merely the few portions which are mentioned by the author, it quickly becomes clear that Sackville-West\'s ""take"" on Joan is largely false. I would recommend Regine Pernoud\'s books instead, many of which are sold on this site."
1976,0,"Flimsy: I ordered these with the concept that they were the sturdy, enameled Wilton cutters I love to use. They are colored aluminum and easily bendable. Arrowed heart shape is not exact (no point to arrow), so any decoration is topical, not exact. These are okay for beginners but not for bakers who do more professional decorating. Disappointed."
1977,0,"bad dubbing?: The sound quality was AWFUL... if there was any way to return to get a better sound I would, but the content was awesome. It sounds like a bad tape-recording dubbed a million times to the point the voices are low and fuzzy. Oh-well. If you love Therese, like we do, you can bear with it and ""offer it up."""
1978,0,"Ruined: I wished a was able to find a copy of S.A. before I got a subscription. The S.A. that I knew this is not. The best features of this magazine have been stripped away. I can't wait for my subscription to end, and I just received my first copy. There are much better hunting magazines out there, wish I had the time to list them."
1979,0,Tabla Book: I was not happy with product and returned the book. My edition was poorly printed and pages were out of order.It covered the basics and then quickly became very complicated. Music books can help a student but best used if one has an instructor.The intricacies of playing the tabla cannot be understood just with a book. I would suggest a book with a CD or DVD.David Courtney's other basic book is much better for the beginner.
1980,0,"Too expensive: This is a first impression review. As the Preface says, the majority of this book consists of appendixes (over 150 pages): list of tals (which, as the autor says, are in some cases extremely old or rare) of prakars, a map of India, how to write the bols (the drum strokes) in Dev Nagri (by the way, all drum strokes syllables throughout the book are written in latin script with the corresponding Dev Nagri above, making space for redundancy), sources where to buy tabla (why use internet?) etc.. I couldnt help but to notice the poor quality of the impression (you can actually see the dots in the black and white photos, but I does not affect the comprehensibility). Overall it seemed to me that the book could be much more compact and that perhaps would make it less expensive."
1981,0,"It wasn't easy to understand. I had no clue!: I wanted to learn tabla so I decided to pick up a book and try. The first few chapters seemed easy enough. Then, all of a sudden, the book went into intrigate details. It just didn't make any sense."
1982,0,"Only buy this if you enjoy being cut: Yes, I did not know you could cut yourself with an electric razor....yes, it did happen and you have been warned."
1983,0,Gothic Icon: Uncle fester reappaers after 25 years in the Bermuda Triangle. Gomez and Morticia plan to wake the dead. Based on the cartoon and TV series.
1984,0,"Slow, marginally entertaining: While the scenes and acting were good and were mostly faithful to the original TV show, the movie plodded along and at a couple points had us asking whether it was over yet."
1985,0,"Not for a Serious Pagan: If you are serious about pursuing Paganism or Wiccan, don't get this book! Just glance through the historical information--it isn't accurate. Also, a Witch and a Wiccan are NOT the same thing and she expressly states that they are. I know quite a few secular witches and Raven Silverwolf does a very good job disregarding them completely.Please, if you are serious about your studies in Wicca or Paganism, do a little research and find a decent author."
1986,0,"Halloween: There are real meanings for the celebration of ""Halloween"". Those who are looking for reality won\'t find it here. Try the search engines under Paganism or Wicca or Goddess Religions. You\'ll find what you\'re looking for there. This book is well let\'s just say ""cutesy"" maybe and like a lot of others on this subject. If you like the author then read her book, this one is about as good as her others. If you want something more substantial and for the more mature crowd, then try Adler, Starhawk, Leek and the rest of the legitimate witches around. You\'ll find them a bit more informative without the kiddy type appeal."
1987,0,"Not an accurate representation of Christianity: Obviously the writer needs to do more research on Christianity ,because I am a believer and I was highly offended by the authors lack of knowledge in the most basic Christ Followers beliefs!He or she wrote that the new testament is based primarily on Roman beliefs and that is not at all factual.Their are many other discrepancies present. I believe the author should talk about things that they understand and the author should have a better understanding of the subject matter."
1988,0,"Certainly not for pagans: I have been impressed with the general series on the Sabbats by Llewellyn, but this was awful. It wasn't written for Pagans. It was written to fit that marketing niche that witches get around Halloween. I was looking for a thoughful book for Wiccans on an important Sabbat, which this is not. Two pages of the book address ritual. There are tons of party recipes and silly love potions."
1989,0,"Not another Ravenwolf book.: Huzzah for the reader from the US for calling it like it is. As a Pagan and an owner of a metaphysical bookstore, I have read a considerable amount of books on Paganism and Witchcraft. To tell you the truth Ravenwolf is just the kind of author the the movement doesn't need. Save your money for something with a little more seriousness. Try the Farrar's or Cunningham's earlier work."
1990,0,"Amazed: I give a one to the writer because they know how to capitalize on their own magical economical development. Amusing. Keep going, there are still new people falling off the tomato truck every day."
1991,0,"O Rating For 0 Book: Really if it\'s not even published why is it here? Hopefully it will not be published. Other works you have attempted to write and call \'books\' are filled with such foolishness about the Craft that it is impossible for anyone to know what you as a writer are trying to establish in the literary field. It is obvious you have many names and many beliefs which have shown as contradictions to one another throughout your books. Even many of the young people are picking up on it. But some of the youth are much more aware and not as gullble as adults in the Pagan world. But I don\'t have to tell you that. Otherwise you wouldn\'t bother to publish this book ""Costumes, Receipes and Spells"" Is it your contention to insist that all this is what the holiday Pagans celebrate is connected with. Oh, Silver your truths are beginning to come out, don\'t you think? What goes round, comes round and it comes round in multiples."
1992,0,"IS IT OUT???: Uh, is this book even on the market yet? When did it come out? If it is it sure is strange because so far I haven't found it in stores anywhere. Anyone got correct info here?"
1993,0,"I read it.: I wouldn\'t recommend it. Pick a topic. Insert ""but then the Christians......"". Repeat. The author us ckear that there is not a lot of source material to support his position. So ultimately it is a work of historical fiction."
1994,0,"sugar coated tripe: This is a farce and dishonor to Halloween. Part of it are true, but then it seems like it gets dipped in a sugary mess. Only good thing is it was a free book."
1995,0,"disappointed: The quality of the printing in this book is terrible. I can barely read it and can not tell anything from the pictures. I am also disappointed because Amazon does not offer the chance to read some of the pages to see what a book has. I want a book about trees that gives details about the trees and their characteristics, so that I can pick the trees for my situation."
1996,0,"Fansubbed bootlegs - don't buy.: These episodes have not been released in the U.S. yet, and probably won't be for years. These are fansubbed bootlegs, low quality, and unauthorized. Buying this supports only the pirates who put it out, and won't do a thing to reward the artists who originally created the work. Don't buy it."
1997,0,"Makes you want to invent new swear words: This is by far the worst PRODUCT I have ever purchased. I hate this coffee maker. I paid $79 for this item and I want to smash it with a hammer. I'm not a violent person but when coffee floods your counter you want to crush it. The only way to safely make a pot of coffee is to place it in the sink for fear of flooding. Even with the lid perfectly clean and on properly, it leaks coffee between the carafe and the lid.To boot, pouring water into the reservoir is a chore & no matter how careful you are, you will have coffee on the counter. Like another reviewer the clock does not keep time. You need to reset it on a regular basis.For the first 30 days or so I actually liked the thing but as you can tell my opinion has definitely changed. Good luck to you if you buy this product."
1998,0,Look for a different coffeemarker: Right from the start I have had problems with this coffee marker.The timer/clock loses about 5 minutes a day so I'm always resetting the time to the correct time so that the automatic start feature will work.The lid on the thermos leaks during brewing. Which means coffee spills everywhere including on the maker which also shuts the coffee marker off. So I end up with coffee everywhere and have to wait hours before I can even think of using the marker again.I have owned the coffee maker for less than 30 days and I think I will be looking for a replacement tomorrow.
1999,0,"2 out of 2 - Kaput!!!: Absolutely love the design, am heartsick that my first unit and the replacement BOTH quit working after about 3-4 weeks.... local service NOT existent.... Amazon replacement policy super.... but basic design problem, methinks.... water flows all over occasionally and pc board stops working when wet with coffee..... just wish unit would work, and;or service center would be avail.... unit probably should be recalled.......Ron Romanski"
2000,0,over priced plastic leaking doesn't keep coffee hot JUNK: No stars is what this should be. Where do I start??? The machine brews the coffee everywhere but into the caraffe. You will have coffee grinds and water all over your counter if you don't position the caraffe in the exact spot it needs to be (so forget setting the timer for the a.m. or you will be needing your mop). The so called thermal caraffe is junk. Plan on a refill 15 minutes after your first cup? You'll have to nuke it as the thermal caraffe does not keep coffee warm at all. You know those little holes that the coffee pours into during brewing...I think it lets the heat out as well. This is the WORST coffee machine I have ever owned and it is the most expensive one I have ever owned. I'm going back to the nine ninety nine specials. At least they work.
2001,0,Worst quality coffee maker ever!: Clock started losing time the first day. Great tasting coffee. No problem with the carafe. Unit stopped working all together after about 10 days. Returned it to DeLonghi & they promptly sent me another. Clock started losing time the first day. Great tasting coffee. No problem with the carafe. Unit stopped working all together after about 10 days. This could get real old....
2002,0,"Horrible Purchase: My husband bought this for me 8/2007. Love the look - all stainless steel. Hate the machine! This coffee maker leaks everywhere. The coffee overflows from the hole and doesn't go in the pot. Also, the seal on the pot does not seal between the lid and pot, so coffee bubbles from there as well. Very poor design. I've set the timer and had to mop my entire kitchen floor and clean my counter tops, cabinet faces, and even inside my cabinets b/c the coffee overflowed and I didn't know until it was too late. Also, if you're lucky enough to get coffee in the pot, don't try to pour it into a cup unless you're over the sink b/c it leaks from the seal between the pot and the top and pours poorly. This is by far the most expensive coffee pot I've ever owned and I'm going to try to return it to Amazon or DeLonghi and break out my old Mr. Coffee ulgy, but no mess coffee maker!"
2003,0,"Poor: You get what you pay for. This hard hat offers very little protection, and it doesn't have enough adjustments to make it fit properly.Get something better. A lot better."
2004,0,"Did not work with HD size 750GB: I bought this to upgrade my HD to a size 750GB. It did not work, the software came with it was very old and gave me a message something like ""different partition size between the 2 drives, not supported"" I went online and download Acronis Migrate Easy 7.0. It\'s free for 15 days. It also gave me an error message saying there are bad partition in my computer\'s HD and I need to fix those first. I ran the disc error check but everything was fine. Took me whole day nothing worked.I ended up went to best buy and bought a USB 3.0 case ""Rocketfish"" and use the Acronis Migrate Easy 7.0 free demo to clone the HD. Everything was done within 2 hours. So If you are buying a bigger HD, I say don\'t buy this. I think the problem is there is no power cord, it doesn\'t support the bigger HD. The Rocketfish I bought has 2 USB connector and I connect both, the computer saw the disc right away."
2005,0,"Not to good: The product didn't work on my windows vista. After folowing the simple directions and watching different videos on how to use it on youtube, I gave it a try, only to have a window pop up saying ( that blocks of differents sizes cannot be cloned?) So I emailed the company and they said it would not clone my hard drive but gave me a couple of things to try to get it to work. Anyway to make a long story shorter, I paid a company 65 dollars to clone my hard drive and this products is neatly tucked away in the bottom of one of my junk bins. If it would have worked on my computer it would have been sweet. If it works on yours you will like it. No one bothered to explain what a block is to me, sooo you can take your chances."
2006,0,Bad Software But Great Hard Drive Case: I couldn't use the software at all. I emailed the company and never heard from them. So I had to just install my new hard drive and use my restore disks. I don't any of my programs that I got from Giveaway of the Day among others. They are still setting on the old hard drive though. I don't know if I can get those back or not without buying more software and getting the operating system too. The product claims that it's so ease but it's anything but that. The product created more problems. The only good thing about the product is that now I have a nice protective case to store my old hard drive.
2007,0,"Doesn't work with Dell Laptops: I have attempted to clone hard drives two different times: once on my Latitude D820 and again on my Latitude E8400. Both times were a complete disaster. Somehow I had neglected to check the reviews, where I now find that this product is not compatible with Dell. No wonder I had such problems. A perfect waste of money! All because Apricorn doesn't caution the purchaser about this problem."
2008,0,Bad experience: The software did not follow the sequence expected and was not able to clone the 100GB hard drive on my Thinkpad to a new 500GB drive.
2009,0,No not EZ: When I first got this I tried to use it with the quick instructions on the package. Big mistake. I wasted hours this way. Only after I downloaded the detailed instructions from their website was I able to get it to work properly.

I also purchased the optional power supply unit because the manual says the USB port might not have enough power. Still doesn't work, don't waste your money....Even further review, Now they are trying to double bill me. I purchased this through Amazon and now they just sent me a separate bill in the mail.....

I will remember to read the fine print in the future. On the other hand, a disk migration maybe something people do once... and then return the device, so this non-return policy has some merit."
2014,0,"Hostile Packaging: I am just getting started. Took me several minute just to open the package. This is one of those welded clear plastic packages. Just cutting one or two sides of the package is not enough. With it's 3d standing plastic shape it is even harder than a normal welded plastic packaging. At least for web / mail orders, it would be desirable to minimize the packing, reduce waste, save blood, and save time. Now to actually try the product."
2015,0,"Not for Dell Computer\'s with Media Direct: I ordered this and was excited to be getting a larger hard drive. The process went smoothly, then I put in the new drive and it said ""hard drive failure"". What the heck! I tried to run it again and guess what?... It does not even recognize it as a hard drive now.Called technical support and they gave me about 100 things to do to correct it. Took about 18 hours. You would think with Dell computers they might put a caveat on their product that it doesn\'t work. Totally unprofessional!!"
2016,0,Not for Dell LapTop with Media Direct: If you have a Dell LapTop with Media Direct; do your home work. This product may work fine on other systems and I bet it does - BUT Dell is a living H*LL as the MediaDirect software on the HD is not copyable and corrupts the copying process. They (Apricorn) will send a work around but I have not figured it out yet (You can not talk to anyone). I have MediaDirect 2 on my HD. How do you know?Go to MyComputer -RightClick- Storeage - Disk Management. And as you look at the Hard drives you will see the partitions if you only see three - then you have MediaDirect 2 - meaning it is invisible. And then you should just forget it.
2017,0,"Does not work any more...: If you read the reviews sorted by date you see a clear trend - THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS STOPPED WORKING!We used to use it to upgrade our Dell laptop hardrives, but about 6 months ago it stopped creating bootable drives. Much time on the phone has not solved the problem...To bad - it used to be a neat thing."
2018,0,"Does not work with newer drives: I tried this product with three different SATA II drives, and none worked.

2019,0,"MIght work for someone else, but not me: I tried it on my laptop first. It took a long time to create the image on the new HD from the old HD. After I replaced the new HD in to the laptop, it powered up but stopped on a blank screen with a blinking cursor. So I tried it on a desktop. The result was the same even though it was stuck on a different screen. I wasted a day and a half(about 20 hours) without getting anywhere. Returned it for refund. I think products like this have to rouburst, and easy to install. However when messing with the registry of the OS, it can get very tricky for different brand/type of computers."

I was persistent and surfed the web to find some help, and I found some of the other reviewers had the same problem as me.Frustrated on Saturday morning, I ran to my local computer store (Kaplan) and bought ANOTHER hard drive upgrade kit, but a different brand for 40 more bucks. The second hard drive kit I bought had a power cord and a USB cord, and it worked!(The apricorn unit only had a usb cable, but funny enough they list a power cable on their website as a recommended accessory)I would say buyer beware, unless you want to waste 40 bucks like me."
2022,0,No Support: Ordered despite seeing reviews cautioning about poor documentation and situations where product does not work. Attempts to contact Apricorn via phone (800# on product for example) or email were waste of time.One review found via Google suggested a situation similar to my experience and possible solution/workaround. Cannot find the article again. Have to wonder why Apricorn cannot provide same info.The reviews noting poor support were correct.

It cloned my hard drive easily and quickly. Only problem is that is will not increase the size of my C Drive. It puts all the new space on the D Drive which defeats the purpose.I've been inspected by an Apricorn rep to purchase Partition Magic or some other program that can move partitions. I've already spent $150 on a pretty old laptop, now spend another $60. At this point is would have been better to simply buy a new machine. Thats what I should have done long ago."
2025,0,"Doesn't work for me: Load the software and it simply gives and error when I try to duplicate my drives that the sizes do not match. I write software and this is just wrong. The software should not throw an error, but rather fix the problem for me automatically. It should adjust the cluster sizes (or whatever) so that it can copy or it should figure out another way to copy the data. It has made both my upgrade drive and this software useless. The only good thing about this product is the USB casing that comes with the software and that's why I am not giving it a one.Just a warning that it probably won't work for you if you are upgrading to a different drive. In my case I was upgrading from a 500GB to 750GB drive."

It would stop at around 90% copied and refuse to go any further. I tried all the clone routines on the Apricorn FAQs and the common solutions on their support phone tree to no avail. I ran diagnostics on the new drive and everything looked fine, tried to clone again with no success.My advice: If it doesn't work right out of the box, return it for a refund.

I emailed a request for help on Friday the 8th, todayMonday the 11th I received a email that asked me to look for the disk in disk management, not there. Then asked me what product I bought, and finally is it PATA or SATA. Here is my suggestion. 1. purchase a cheap enclosure 2. install your new hard drive. 3. download EASEUS todo B/U for free, clone your drive, install the new one, and save yourself around $40.00 plus the time and trouble."

Missy and Tim are very talented individuals for what they do. However, Gospel music is Gospel music. Don\'t get it twisted, it\'s more than vocals, hooks and bringing in a ""big name"" producer to work on your project. . . IT\'S A LIFESTYLE. It just didn\'t FEEL like genuine Gospel music. I was also distracted by the monotone-like lyrics and vocal arrangement in ""Second Chance."" Definitely not her best stuff."

2062,0,"Inferior to other train tables: This train table is poorly designed in many ways. First of all, the storage area under the table for the buckets is set up so that you have to pull out at least one of them to access the others. Second, the track pieces aren't completely flush and cause the trains to catch. That would be ok if the magnets were stronger, but even on straight sections the cars often separate, and definitely around curves and up hills. Overall, I wish I had shopped around a lot more."

The cars and trucks drive better on the train tracks than the actual train cars, the cargo boxes do not stay on the train cars very well, the buildings (aside from the one 3-D one) are just thin squares that you just stand up, so they knock over with any movement of the table, in reality, all of the accessories do. I know this is a cheaper set, but I'm sure some of the more expensive ones are of better quality. You really can't even push the train through the tunnel under the waterfall, and my kid is two... So I couldn't imagine other children being able to."

Trains don't go underneath some tracks and our son gets annoyed! Do not purchase...invest in more durable and expensive one!!!!
2065,0,"A bit dull.: ""Message From Home"" was the first of (so far) three albums by Pharoah Sanders produced by Bill Laswell and the first album by Sanders in quite a long time (I think since the \'70s) to consist of all originals. It is not, unfortunately, very good.The album consists largely of synthesizer driven mid-tempo grooves well informed with percussion washes and fiery playing from Sanders. At its best, it proves pleasant enough (vocal chant-and-flute piece ""Kumba""), at worst it finds Sanders in drastic opposition to the music (ballad ""Nozipho"" finds Sanders overblowing and screeching against a soporific backdrop). It\'s not unlistenable, but its not the kind of record you\'ll be reaching for.Sanders and Laswell would succeed much more on their future efforts, this one is really pretty far from essential."

Your money - because even if you do not break it you will be buying expensive batteries to keep it running. Not water proof or resistant - I live in Monterey, California and we do not get much rain out here, nor do I like to ride in the rain. That said this light was ruined by what little water it came in contact with or by the process of changing out the rusted batteries for new ones. Whichever the cause...it is a testament to quality and/or durability. Bottom line is this light is cheaply made! I am now looking for a light that uses a more common/cheaper battery (like AA or AAA) and that is actually water resistant!"

It's highly biased to the point of containing inaccurate information, and the content/topics the author chose to include (or chose not to include) is questionable as well. It's as if the author wrote it from memory during a creative streak but couldn't be bothered to check her sources. I used to be a big fan of those novel-like biographies for kids, which is what this book is reminiscent of, but calling this a history textbook is a whole 'nother story. Unfortunately, some (private) schools are still using this, including the one I went to when I was a kid in MA."

Tried the slapshot game and got lost as to which class was which and which code went where. It's great if you want something to sit on your shelf and look pretty, maybe for moderate reference, but not practical or easy enough to read.

The install overwrites your joystick settings that you set up with the MW4 patch 2 version 2. Switching from chain fire to group fire etc doesn\'t ""stick"" and you have to keep re-switching.

And that is the weakness of Black Knight-- mission after mission. You can't. On most of the missions, you ought to have two lances or more, but you will have to cross your fingers and try to beat the four to one odds with your one lance and on again, off again lancemates. Perhaps Mechwarrior: Mercenaries spoiled me badly, but I was too busy cursing like a werewolf for most of the missions in Black Knight at the lousy odds and even worse mission profiles to enjoy any of it. Now, if they had let me import my gear and lances from Mercenaries to this one.... that would have been different. To #@%%% with the Legion, Spectre Lance rules."

In my opinion projection is low, as well as duration. I get 4-5 hours on my skin. Good for work I would say, unoffensive.The bottle is poorly made, the sprayer started failing and the liquid started to leak. I had to change the bottle in less than a week. Since the bottle has this strange design it's not possible to know where the failure is."
2098,0,Emporio Armani: I have been looking all over for this product. I was a little disappointed on paying so much for so little.
2099,0,"Not Saying Much....: Saying this is the best Savoy Brown release in a number of years is not really saying a whole heck of a lot. True Simmonds can play a mean guitar, but so can dozens of other blues artists. What really bothers me about this disc is the weak vocals from Simmonds; and the musicians for hire approach. Just call this a Kim Simmonds solo album and I\'ll maybe add another star. This is just straight ahead, workmanlike, ""whiteboy"" blues in the tradition (or re-tread-ition) of John Mayall; however Simmonds is no Clapton, Green, or Taylor. I\'ve listened to the disc a few times and the repeated listenings have done nothing to change my opinion. Now it\'s headed for auction on eBay.Unlike my vinyl copies of ""Blue Matter"" & ""Raw Sienna"" which I sleep with under my pillow. ""Lonesome Dave"" rest in peace."
2100,0,"Milkin' it lame: Re-tread songs, helpless rhythm section, HORRIBLE singing...this is the worst CD I bought this year. Try to get some classic SB instead, because this sounds like it was recorded in someone's garage. Painful and sad. Milk it, Kim."
2101,0,Jimmy Carter is no Rick Bragg: I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book being a great fan of all Southern writings and writers. I especially enjoyed the wonderful It's All Over But the Shoutin' by Pulitzer Prize winner Rick Bragg.Let me say I have always admired Jimmy Carter; he seems a man of virtue and honor. Unfortunately he can't write and someone should have told him. I found the book repetitive and monotonous and in need of an editor with the best organizational skills. Carter jumped from one subject to another continously without any hint of where he may be going.
2102,0,"I like Cater, but can't cotton his writing: Why is it that ex-presidents make poor writers? Is it that they have had to hide their feeing so long they are afraid to loosen up afterward because we might think less of them? I was looking forward to reading about a boy growing up in Georgia while I was growing up in Iowa, but his writing is so stiff and lifeless that I quit halfway through."
2103,0,"Cheap Cheap don't bother: These are a cheap ripoff imitation of the real thing. Or perhaps the real thing has gotten really bad. When you squeeze the clamps, the handles just bend rather than the clamp opening! Luckily they took them back. The problem is, I CANT FIND the real thing at ANY PRICE."
2104,0,"frustrating for the DSLR photographer: I\'m sure this was a great book, 8 years ago (i\'d give it 4 stars then), but it\'s taken me forever to get through the book when every other technique is a film-specific technique like ""duplicating slides"", ""pushing film, or ""cross-processing"", or is referring to specific cameras, film types, etc to get desired results. most of this can be done in photoshop with one dslr and a couple lenses.thankfully, i just saw that Frost has released a new version of this book specific to digital photography. i probably wouldn\'t buy it though. i hope i can sell this used."
2105,0,"Pretty, but don't buy: We purchased one of these because it was pretty, and had some neat features. What we didn't realize was that pretty doesn't make good coffee. Within a few short months, the timer and automatic start went out--shortly after, the fancy swing arm broke, too. We mailed it back and waited for a new one. Sure enough, the timer on the new one pooped out after just a few weeks, and a year later the arm broke *again*. Emails to the company (nice ones!!) were not returned. When we finally got in touch with them we were told that although this is a common problem, since it had been over one year we were out of luck. This product simply costs too much to dispose of after a year, especally as our $20, 7 year old Mr. Coffee still works better than the DeLonghi. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it."
2106,0,DeLonghi: Horrible... coffee doesn't taste that great... especially for the price... mine broke after 2 months... the lid of the carafe just snapped off... so the coffee won't drip into the pot
2107,0,"Long-winded: Perhaps 100 years ago, readers considered this to be a great book. However, today, the average reader will find it to be long-winded. The introduction is actually the first 5 chapters, at least. I gave up after chapter 5."
2108,0,"JR in San Diego: While it's cool to have Donal Trump cologne in your bathroom for people to see, don't wear it because it sucks. Kinda smells like Windex with a little Pine Sol added. But hey, that's not why you bought it really."

2113,0,The Butcher's Wife: I brought this DVD from Amazon and could never watch it because it says it's incompatable with my DVD player....DVD was made in Mexico.
2114,0,"movie doesn't play: The packaging was terrific. The movie appeared in good shape, new looking. When I put the movie into the DVD player, an error appeared in my top left corner of my television screen. The movie does NOT work at all. This truely saddens me due to the fact that I have wanted to watch this movie since I watched it when it first came out!!!"
2115,0,"Bad as three-day-old ground chuck...: Five minutes into The Butcher\'s Wife, my thought was, ""The has got to be a vanity project."" It feels like Demi Moore\'s version of Eddie Murphy\'s Vampire In Brooklyn, a movie were a megastar is attached, everyone lets them do their own thing, and no one wants to tell them, look, this isn\'t working. The cast does try hard, but the inept script gives them nothing to work with. The DVD quality is mediocre at best. From the opening seconds of the film, the screen is crawling with grain, not made any better by the low video bitrate. Audio is passable, and the only extra is a laughably bad trailer. Fans of Demi Moore -- if there are any left after The Scarlet Letter or G.I. Jane -- may want to add this to their collection, but the other 6,185,348,023 of you in the world will want to give it a pass."
2116,0,"wow, they really phoned in this performance...: If you like seeing a band at less than optimum capacity, with warts and all then this one should be in your collection. Townsend and Daltrey really seem to be bickering back and forth about something. This Who DVD doesn\'t seem to have the ""fire"" of their other work."
2117,0,"Complete CRAP!!!: I\'m not sure what went wrong with the production of this DVD, but whoever signed off on it as a ""professional, commercial product"" most certainly should be shot. Repeatedly. In the head.This DVD is unwatchable crap that looks like it was recorded using a cellphone camera. For example, anytime the camera points to the lights on stage, the video blows out, meaning that the band mates disappear into a blur of bright yellow. Of course, comparing this DVD\'s video quality to that of a cellphone\'s, is an insult to cellphones.It was mentioned in a previous review that this concert was for charity, so if you\'re feeling charitable and want to waste your money, go ahead and buy the DVD and use it for target practice (a la ""Success Story"") but if you\'re looking for a good Who concert DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!"
2118,0,"Cheap DVD: As much as I like the Who and as much as I believe that they have really come back from the dead recently, this is a really crap DVD of a really good band. It comes across as a quick cash-in with low quality-control. If you are a Who completist why not. Otherwise the Albert Hall DVD is better as is the Isle of Wright or the Kids Are Alright. Avoid this one."
2119,0,"this is not the WHO at there best: why was this dvd of the who ever produced,it is terrible, i know the who did this session for charity but oh,why put the concert onto dvd its awfull, wait until the who produce a dvd of one of the concerts where they have had time to practise at least..dont buy if your a fan & if not dont be put off by this dvd"

I have purchased Maxit products before and was pleased until now. I was enticed when I saw the regular retail and then the closeout price, assuming I was getting a deal. The regular retail for the shirt is 10.99 and should be sold for $3 or $4 max! Also, no where close to an Under Armour Shirt..."
2121,0,"I\'m a huge fan of Mr. Shearing, but......: There have been few people to approach G. Shearing\'s talent for playing the piano. This record was no exception as his phrasing and arranging done ""internally"" on one instrument is typically impeccable. The selection of material is likewise very, very good. However, this recording was done at the private studio of Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer in 1974. While the equipment there might have been quite good for a private studio in 1974, the tape noise on the recording is so pronounced as to be a real distraction. Perhaps as an MP3 recording listened to in a car this would be an acceptable level of fidelity, but on a decent modern home system....no. This is the first Shearing recording I\'ve ever regretted purchasing. That\'s the bad news. The good news is that there are numerous other examples of his talent out there in print and many of them sound absolutely wonderful, even for their age."
2122,0,earings: Earings are too big...no way of knowing they were as big as they are...nothing i will wear....
2123,0,"Don't Get Ripped Off!: This book ISN'T out of print. An edition from Cambridge University Press is available on Amazon. This version contains dark scanned pages from a previously owned copy, replete with underlinings and scrawled marginal notes. I'm not joking. I looked up the publishing company (Kessinger), and it appears this kind of dodgy business is their schtick. The CUP version only costs a little more, and it's, well, you know, a normal book.As far as Bradley's thought is concerned. I've only read the shorter appearance bit thus far, but if want to see metaphysics at its most unhinged, this is the book for you. I for one love it."
2124,0,"Great book poor Kindle transfer.: This is very significant treatise on first principles. However the Kindle version is irritatingly sloppy. Poor format, poor transfer, - at times only the context of the scrambled ""word"" will reveal the actual word Bradley wrote. I hope my friends at Amazon will redo this text and notify those of us who purchaed it that a faithful copy is now available."
2125,0,"tiny. difficult to adjust. painful to wear: I got a lackluster and marginally impersonal response from this company when I wrote in and asked them if they'd accidentally sent me a child-size toe ring. I'd never received one so tiny before or had this issue at all via amazon, let alone brick & mortar jewelry stores. It is a pain to adjust, and will slip off adjusting it to the size of my other toe rings when they're not extended whatsoever. That was my cue that I wasn't imagining the discrepancy lol it's painful to keep on when adjusted to the point that it won't slip off. Save your $ unless you're buying it for a toddler. If you extend it so it fits your smallest, normal-sized adult toe, it will fall off. If you tighten it enough so that it will stay on, you can't walk. Someone in eve'saddiction manufacturing dropped the ball somewhere"
2126,0,It broke after a week!: I had originally written a review about this ring after I received it. It was a good review because I was happy at the time. HOWEVER I just had to edit my review because I have only had this ring exactly a week and one of the longest arms or w/e it is broke off!! And dont be fooled the stone in the middle is not like that it is a very small stone in a cone type thing and also it was a little hard to adjust the first time. I will not be purchasing anything else from this company. The only reason it is 2 stars is because I DID like the ring at first.
2127,0,"Dropped The Ball!: This books began with all the bang and whistles of a great story. In fact, the story in its self is not to shabby, but every chapter following the first became increasingly predictable and when I gladly got to the end of the book the story had turned into the most cliched work of fiction I\'d ever encountered. Someone please inform this storyteller about ""Spell Check,"" and all the other grammer tools available theses days. The 2nd and 3rd act dropped the ball completely. The reader is able to pick out the exact movie where every inspiration for acts 2 & 3 was borrowed. And badly borrowed at that! For all of us trying to find an Ethnic Storyteller to embrace; this storyteller is not ""The One!""I strongly suggest you look elsewhere.For example...""LaErtes, The King of Horra/Thrilla!"""
2128,0,"Good, but not great: As most writers grow older, their skills diminish. So with Enter the Milkman. A lot of the book is padding - each character repeating the same thing over and over again. MacLeod's books are humorous mysteries and the humor is there but the mystery is not that taxing. Her earlier books are masterpieces, so get this one to fill out the set."
2129,0,"Why in the world isn't this thing letterboxed!?: The movie itself gets at least four stars, but minus two for the studio for being so purblind as to issue it with a third of the picture lopped off. Gee, folks, can't you at least give us a choice to watch the entire movie?"
2130,0,"A Joke: One reviewer called it the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made. Well, to me, it's the worst ever made. Only the cinematography and the settings are worth a nod. The foreign accents are amateurishly inept and Holmes, never mind the stature of Nicol Williams, is quite miscast. Storyline and much of the dialogue are idiotic and aimed at a very low viewer intelligence"
2131,0,Just OK: It's just like any other product of its kind. I have heard their quality gone worse ever since they started manufacturing outside Japan. Looks like its true.
2132,0,i hate it: looks good only!!! :) you guys have to think twice or more before buy. make sure and odor and very dry
2133,0,"irritating: I've never had any kind of allergic reaction to condoms before, but these were highly problematic. It took a couple months for, er, things to be back to normal."
2134,0,"Not what I was hoping: Unfortunately these can be sold by a variety of retailers and fulfilled by Amazon. I just bought some sold by ASBKC_Group, and unfortunately, these are the ""bad"" ones made in Taiwan. There goes my $10 gamble."
2135,0,this condom routinely rips: I am not a very large individual but I would say 10-20% of the condoms rip. That is a major concern. Be careful if you are even slightly around average sized.Also mine did not come as a variety package. It was one type of the condom in a lose envelope (which was fine with me).
2136,0,"too small!: Yes, they are super thin. However, we found them way too small. They were uncomfortable for my husband to wear and spoiled all the fun. Stay away from these if you consider yourself ""bigger."" We\'ve read great reviews about these and were really dissapointed. So... two stars."
2137,0,"Great...if you like getting pregnant: Yeah. That's right... these condoms feel A-OK as far as condoms go. And they are cheap cheap cheap! Wonder why? Because they break and you get pregnant. I ought to sue Crown for child support, b/c babies ain't cheap! (Yes, i kept the resulting baby!)My husband and I will NEVER BUY THESE AGAIN..."
2138,0,"These break wayyy too much.: Don't get me wrong, these condoms make it feel as if you're not wearing anything if there's enough lubricant. The problem is, the second you start getting a little rough and start deep thrusting, these things break easily. I've had them break on me three times. They are also a little tight. I threw mine away. I'll be sticking with Trojan."
2139,0,"need extra lubrication: The price of these condoms combined with the speed of the shipping are the only reasons this product received two stars. The reviews stating that these condoms feel like nothing are overexagerating. These condoms fit too snugly and feel like a raincoat. Additionally, the condoms are lightly lubricated so that if you last more than 5 minutes you have to stop and apply more lubrication. This can ruin the atmosphere and sometimes the mood. Anyways I will be keeping the last six of these condoms for emergencies and my gf and I will keep searching for the perfect condom."
2140,0,Don't buy it: This condom has no (or too little) lubrication. The resulting friction is too high. It's difficult to move and causes pain and potential injury.
2141,0,"horrible, horrible condoms: These were definitely too small (in terms of girth) and neither my boyfriend or I could feel a thing. They weren't lubricated very much either. I'm really disappointed, even more so since my order was delivered 5 days late. All that time wasted for nothing."
2142,0,VERY slow: I ordered this product Nov. 17 and as of Dec. 10 it still has not arrived. Is this acceptable? Not in my book.
2143,0,"Small and dry: I made the mistake of purchasing a large quantity of these on sale instead of trying a few to see if we liked them first. Now, I'm stuck with 97 condoms that are all but useless. Maybe we'll have a balloon party.First of all, the packages can be difficult to gain access to. I wasn't intoxicated while using these, but they are more difficult to open than our usual durex and sometimes magnums.The fit on these is tight, specifically the girth. While the material is very thin, I can feel the restriction and it is distracting. The length is average and adequate.Worst of all, these lost all lubrications in 5-10 minutes. Twice I had to apply extra lubrication (think baby powder dry) and the most recent time I just gave up and called it a night.Shipping was fairly prompt from the seller, but the questionable packaging, small fit (must have done their product testing in Asia) and extreme lack of lubrication make these the worst condom I have ever used."
2144,0,Too small: These condoms are no good. The first one I put on felt too tight and ripped while I was trying to put it on. The length is fine but not good if you have normal or above average girth.
2145,0,"Too small.: As has been said, they may be thin, but unless your average or smaller, they do not fit. Anyone want to buy like 245 condoms? lol"
2146,0,"Small: this condoms is a nice a chip option , but they are small to use in a person Or toy 's whit a large and width penis.For the average its ok , the material so thin and can be broke easy , take a note in that ."
2147,0,Not good..very less lubrication: This product promised a lot. Though it is very thin..the lack of lubrication kills the advantage.Sex is all about the feel and while i understand it has less lub..i didnt expect it to have Zero lube.It is not comfortable for the partner as well.So i wud still stick to Durex that got from Amazon - The deal is good so is the satisfaction
2148,0,"Too thick: I ordered same product a few years ago.However I cannot order the same product anymore.As someone mentioned, they is not available anymore.The factory is moved to thailand from Japan.Then, the quality becomes worse.My wife and I cannot feel anymore.Please try another one if you can."
2149,0,not as described: When i put in my order it was described as made in japan. I got my package and it is made in thailand.
2150,0,Get what you pay for: I bought these because they have been called awesome by so many people. The problem is that they are small. DO NOT get these if you have a large penis.
2151,0,items not delivered: the seller accepted payment and wasn't able to deliver to APO address in UK- it's the first time such things has happened to me - if a seller doesn't deliver to APO address then they do not accept money

2153,0,"oops: Recently I bought Crown condoms. I thought this could cheep and works well but when I use with my girl friend it tore, I was really shocked because this is the first time I am seeing that condoms also tore. I suggest don't ever try to buy this kind if cheep and useless condoms, be safe and secure yourself."
2154,0,"Not what they claim to be: We\'ve had these condoms for over a year now... That should tell you enough about how much my wife and I like them. They really don\'t help with keeping the ""sensations"". My wife hates them and I really have to work to finish at times (and really - I\'m not typically a marthon runner when it comes to sex).Some reviews claim these are knock offs....I\'m lead to believe them since I\'ve heard great things about this brand elsewhere."
2155,0,"Broke: These condoms worked all right but the last one we used ripped around the base area, not sure if it was already broken or not but it was an unpleasant discovery. Thank god I'm on birth control."
2156,0,"2nd batch too small: I\'ve bought these before on Amazon through a different 3rd party seller and all 100 were perfect - normal sized, thin, and slightly lubricated. This box of them that I just bought through the ""ChubbyDickEmporium"" however, are way too short, too constricting, and not lubricated. I cannot use them. Now I have to search for a new condom."
2157,0,"Breakage and stress: 2 out of the first 10 used broke, and I'm not even close to well endowed. Thanks for an unreliable product and unneeded stress..."
2158,0,NOT your favorite new thin condom: This condom is just average. The thin Durex offer more sensation. I am very disappointed and would likely not use the product.
2159,0,"They break.: I stopped using these condoms after using about ten of them. Although they are great when they work, of the ten that I used three of them broke. I have never had another condom break on me."
2160,0,cold blanket: i was enthralled with this when i first got it but the ice does not last that long and the rectangles are prone to breaking. great idea but not sturdy at all.
2161,0,"Disappointing: I've never asked Amazon for a refund. This was a first. I read the reviews. All gave high ratings. My experience differs. Yes, the cashews are jumbo, in fact they're huge. However, they lacked flavor and many had a harder, more brittle texture then I'm use too. Oh well back to Planters."
2162,0,Average at best: Was expecting much better quality. A slightly stale taste with a minimum amount of sprayed on salt. Very disappointed with the nuts. If it wasn't such a hassle I would try for a refund.
2163,0,"Original ARTIST, but REMADE hits: None of these are original recordings. Highly disappointing. The audio also has a weird echo, making all the songs sound like they were recorded in a dingy nightclub rather than a recording studio. But there are no audience sounds, so who knows. If you\'re looking for some classic ORIGINAL Roy Clark hits, don\'t bother with this one. You\'ll be disappointed. This one goes straight to the top of the ""trade-in"" pile for the local Used CD Store."
2164,0,"Ummm.. Don't know what to say: I don't like this book so far. I haven't read all of it, and if my opinion changes, i intend to post another review. But after reading Flowers in the Attic, I find it hard to fall in love with Olivia like I did Cathy or any other heroines. She just seemed so harsh in FITA, that it's difficult to believe that this is the same grandmother"
2165,0,"This story line is getting really really really old: I loved FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC. PETALS ON THE WIND was pretty good. When I read IF THERE BE THORNS it was okay. SEEDS OF YESTERDAY was pretty boring.But this book was shocking for somebody like me.Who really gives about what happened to the stupid granma. I got really bored reading about Catherine and Christopher and their little family, but I wouldn\'t have said anything bad about it.Then came this book. B-O-R-I-N-G. It makes girls and women sound soooooooo vulnerable to men. it\'s scary to think that anyone can even think like that. ""Everything you do wrong takes you one step closer to hell"" is the message you get from this book.I definately wouldn\'t recommend this book to anyone."
2166,0,"FERTILIZER FOR THE GARDEN: This story was so bad that it was EMBARRASSING! Olivia, the matriarch of the Dollanganger twins is featured in this tired prequel. Bitter and resentful over her lot in life, she marries an unloving man named Malcolm and has two sons.Irate over Malcolm's adulterous ways, Olivia understandably resents Malcolm's latest love interest, the lovely Alicia. She doesn't take into consideration that Malcolm rapes Alicia and this act results in the birth of Alicia's daughter, Corinne. Malcolm insists on naming his baby Corinne after his dead mother. During Alicia's pregnancy, Olivia keeps her away from her son Chris (who would later, with Corinne, become the parents of the Dollanger 4) locks her away in the attic (the attic again)!Alicia is a fool for allowing Olivia to spirit Chris away and even more foolish for letting Olivia keep Corinne in that malignant household. Common sense does not enter into this story.This book is good fertilizer for the garden."
2167,0,"Wink Wink Nod Nod We Are So Clever: Don\'t get me wrong Spider Robinson is my favorite author but not even the warmth of Key West where this novel is set could warm me up to it.This is a valuable lesson. Sometimes we must give up our fictional friends. Jake and his friends seem tired and need to rest. They have entertained us but now I feel like a guest at a party that has overstayed his welcome. Everbody is going through the motions but I just don\'t feel it.One of the things I really didn\'t like is Jake and his crew\'s attitude of: ""We are so clever Nod-Nod Wink-Wink."" Everybody has some sort of power incuding his kid. It seems they are running into the same wall that Superman in the comics did. You make a character or a group of them so powerful you really have to strain to come up with a problem worthy of them.In short this book seemed a bit to much by the numbers.As much as I love the characters I hope this is the last I see of them. I will remember them fondly from prior books."
2168,0,"Not the Best Callahan's Book: I've been reading Spider since my first-edition copy of Antinomy 20 years ago (which I still have). This book was, in a word: lame. Too much reliance on mind altering drugs and old formulas. The plot (if you want to call it one) is too formulaic. It takes Spider almost half the book to get them from New York to Key West, another quarter of the book to establish the new bar, and the last quarter to save the world. Where are the puns and character development that made the Callahan's Bar stories so much fun to read? Sorry, Spider. Even Ralph would call this one a dog."
2169,0,"Worst Spider Robinson book I have read: I have loved Callahan books.I have loved almost everything by Spider Robinson before this book.I had great expectations before I started to read this one. Sadly I had to be very disappointed. It seems Spider had material for a short story, and got a contract for a novel. Never have I encountered such amount of padding in any book before. There literary pages and pages of pure, unadulterated padding. There are paragraphs full of names, which are repeated a few pages later. There are sidetracks in the story which lead nowhere, and have no relation with the main plot of the story, and have practically no entertainment value at all.This might have been a fine short story, but this is a horrible novel."
2170,0,"I should have saved my money: This is the first Spider Robinson I have tried to read. I'll take other's word for it that previous books were better. This one is smug, self-indulgent and boring. I kept waiting for them to save the universe and then skimmed through it because it was too silly. I like weird people but these were not interesting. The parrot was a stupid plot device, the baby is creepy (but that dancing baby always creeped me out, too), but I liked being reminded of Pixel. I kept picturing Hans Conried when we saw Nikola Tesla and I don't think that was the image we were supposed to get. I short, I didn't finish it. I should have checked these reviews before I bought it."
2171,0,"Conserve narratives: reuse, reduce, recycle: First, there is nothing new in this book. Everything he says here he has said in the earlier books. Second, there is very little in the way of plot or character development. You are halfway through the book before the threat to the universe is even described. All the characters are almost cameo reprives of previous performances. Except the new characters who are introduced and then promptly droped from the narrative. Third,the few more or less new notes are nearly all obvious reworkings from other writers. The eighteen month old hyperprecocious girl who knows the size of her father's erect penis and has started a waiting list of partners for when she begins having sex just reeks of the Lazarus Long style of deliberately shocking sexuality. Based on this book I would say Spider Robinson has become a tired old man."
2172,0,"Too clever by half. No, more than that.: This is the first book by Spider Robinson I\'ve tried to read. Tried. I couldn\'t try hard enough to get past the incessant cleverness of the dialog and characters. The phrase ""too clever by half"" doesn\'t cover it."
2173,0,"Please don\'t buy this book: I loved the Callahan series. In fact, I love most of what Spider Robinson has written, but this book is boring, self-serving and exists only to help him pay for his latest vacation.I gave this book every chance I could. I would think ""this is boring"", but because it was Spider, I read on. I would think ""what a stupid plotline"", but because it was Spider, I read on. I would think ""this book is going nowhere!"", but because it was Spider, I read on.Two chapters from the end, the book attempts a plot twist. At that point I thought, ""You know what, I don\'t care."", and I closed the book.I never slam a book without offering an alternative. If you want to read an excellent book, try Amy Thomson\'s ""The Color of Distance"" instead. Leave this one on the book store shelf."
2174,0,"Good performance - bad opera: This opera has pretty good singing and that's pretty much all. The sets and cosumes are just Eurotrash and the opera itself has little plot and even less interest. The music is Rimsky Korsakov at his most mechanical and even the orchestration disappoints --- which is unusual for this composer. Unless you enjoy watching a group of stupid drunks stumble around and hit one another, it is simply not worth watching."
2175,0,"A Poor Read - Don\'t Bother: One of the most one-sided, uninspired books I have ever read. Trashes American industry and government at every opportunity while Europeans can do no wrong. The lack of proofreading undermines what little factual information is contained such as confusing Lockheed for McDonnell Douglas. Numerous typos further show a lack of attention such as misspelling the term ""CEO"" (no joke) - AND THIS IS THE SECOND EDITION! Save your money and download a mix of Airbus press releases - at least they may contain a picture or two to distract from the propaganda."
2176,0,"Meh: I got this book hoping to learn more about the Sidhe. It was pretty much a bust in that respect. What this book doesn\'t really come out and tell you is that the whole thing is a series of channeled messages. The key is a design that is a modified spiral, a shape that is known to be able to produce altered states of consciousness. So my question becomes is he talking to one of the Sidhe, to a figment of his own imagination, or something else entirely? My guess is one of the latter 2, because at one point the Sidhe flatly tells him that there is no god, God, or gods, when Celtic myth plainly depicts the Sidhe as what became of the Tuatha de Danaan, when they were forced ""underground"" by the Milesians, and the Tuatha de DID have one or more deities.I never bothered to finish reading it after that."
2177,0,"Blah: I was underwhelmed. It may be that Matthews tuned into a sidhe, but his personal writing lacked gravitas for me, and what the sidhe had to say was way too general. I must have expected some fire, incisive thinking. At the very least a rip-roaring good yarn."
2178,0,"Deeply Disappointing Outing by the Flamenco Maestro: This album is a deep disappointment. On 'Siroco', Paco had pushed the boundaries of Flamenco yet kept its roots. This album, in contrast, sounds like an uninspired rehash. Even the Bulerias 'Compadres' - with Manolo Sanlucar - generates no excitement at all. (Compare this to any Bulerias by Cameron with Paco and Tomatito playing.) The track Zyryab just passes me by - elevator music. Skip this, get Siroco instead."
2179,0,"Not worth your while.: There is much better music around.As largely exemplified by the comments below by the user from New Orleans, music - or whatever - that inpires, generates and promotes such a deluge of condescending, derogatory and hateful remarks towards others is clearly not worth your while.You will do much better spending your time and money elsewhere."
2180,0,"A major bug in the program: This could've been a pretty cool game, but I've become frustrated with it in just one week because of a software glitch.It seems that after you've been running your zoo for a while, you start getting messages that your guests are hungry or thirsty, even if you've added plenty of food and drink stands for them. Although there is a downloadable patch which is meant to address this probelm (...), it didn't work on my system. And the problem multiplies - soon the animals are hungry, even though their zookeepers are right there, and should be feeding them.It seems to me that even if it HAD worked, it's a little unfair to expect users to have to go download a patch just to make the game work. Microsoft should never have released it with a problem this obvious. Have they not heard of playtesting?My recommendation is to WAIT until an updated version has been put on the market before buying it."

2182,0,"Don\'t waste your money....: This is a very poor knock-off of Roller Coaster Tycoon (some of the details of game play are so close, in fact, it makes me wonder...), except that the close-up graphics are terrible, and it\'s very boring. It also takes too much time to get a ""ride"" up and running - by the time you do, your other animals will have died from neglect! Animal sounds are decent, but, overall, game sound is VERY boring - there needs to be more of it. It\'s really a shame, as the idea of this game has great potential. Yet, just another case of Microsoft trying to capitalize on someone elses success. In this case, they\'ve failed terribly. Don\'t waste your money - I did."

2184,0,"I expected it to be better.: I was eagerly anticipating this game before it came out but after playing it for only a month I found that I was quickly getting bored with it. It gets very tedious to make the animals habitats in a way that keeps them happy and I found myself getting annoyed with them wanting more grass, more dirt, more fresh water, on and on and on. The scenarios are particulary boring and don't add anything interesting to the gameplay."
2185,0,"Close, but buggy, and the fix isn\'t.: There\'s no excuse for this game to run that slowly once you have more than about 10 exhibits and 500 guests.What\'s more, when reloading saved games, the exhibit numbers get incremented by the number of exhibits each time, and the game appears to slow down accordingly as well, including scrolling and accepting clicks.This makes it unplayable.It\'s fun until it starts to choke, then it\'s simply annoying.The choking on size was NOT a problem until after I loaded the ""fix"". Before I loaded the ""fix"" it would only crash, not slow down.If this gets fixed, it will be a good game."

2188,0,"Not Much Creativity Invovled At All: Zoo Tycoon as a game is not very fun. The only part about it that might be fun is the fact that the game does not take much time and that it is very easy, especially if you have the strategy guide which is very helpful, but if you have don't expect to be using much brain power when playing this game. Overall I would give this game about a 71%. I'd recommend Roller Coaster Tycoon over this game any day. RTC is at least a bit challenging and some creativity is invovled with it."
2189,0,"Zoo Tycoon: Loaded fine but then couldn't get it to run. Couldn't even get back to a spot where I could get the unique product number. As it turned out, MS doesn't tell you that if you are running a newer version of XP (post Sep 2002, SP1) you have to buy a codec, online, from a thrid party company. For $14.95 additional you can get the game to work on your XP system. MS support was no help. I was very upset and will return to the store I bought it from, Staples."
2190,0,"ZooTycoon: Zoo Tycoon is a great idea and has lots of potental. Beware of trouble. Its is not very compatible with all computer systems. There are alot of software conflicts that I have come across. Tech support is so-so from Microsoft for this game. They always blamed it on the computer and its software that was preloaded. What's so funny is that my new DELL computer is preloaded with Microsoft software. The troubles I am referring to are lock-ups, freezing and slowness of game prior to locks-ups/freezing. Microsoft needs to fix the problems with software conflicts especially when its their software that is the conflict. Graphics and the ideas of the game are great."

2193,0,"Snoozer-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: People say one of the drawbacks for this game is--because it is too much like Roller Coaster Tycoon. However, I, a lover of almost all simulation games and Roller Coaster Tycoon, I disliked this game. Unless you find the concept exciting, do NOT buy this game.Unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon the scenarios are much more boring and broad and after a while (for me, two or three hours) the game became monotanous and boring. It was definately not worth the money and now it is sitting on a quiet dusty shelf.Also, unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon this game appeals to younger age groups. My friend's on (12 yrs. old) loves this game with a passion.So to conclude, I would only recommend buying this game if.....-The idea of building a zoo appeals to you.-If, you are not buying for youself, primarily younger people will take an interest in this.-You don't mind a somewhat monotonous game play."
2194,0,"A Big Disappointment: I really wanted to like this game. I did. The concept was good, the features seemed exciting, and I thought that I would spend many weeks enjoying the game. I was wrong. The game play is awkward. There is a patch on the website that helps a bit, but it doesn't fix everything. The zookeepers and maintence workers do their assigned tasks and then wander off into the undevoloped areas of the park, and then when there is a problem you have to hunt them down and physically move them to where they should have been all along. I have a pretty decent computer with more than double all of the requirements, but the game will still crashed on me. Stick with Rollercoaster Tycoon and its add-on packs, and if you complete all of the theme parks there, then keep searching for a new game. Don't think that Zoo Tycoon will be the fix that you need until more Rollercaster Tycoon add-on packs come out like I did."
2195,0,"crashes and bugs: This game had potential.........but they never worked out the bugs! I find myself worrying about whether the stupid game is going to crash more than winning it! Not only that but you have to start the research projects all over again when the game crashes...even if you saved it. The animals also have issues....like my penguins who after a few months in zoo time froze. I truly was disappointed next time I hope Microsoft fixes the game b4 they release itHowever despite all this...I mastered the game in a few days. Maybe I became tired with the game because I never got far enough to unlock the secrets, which cannot be done if the game crashes every two seconds."

In the end, we were told that we could use any heat transfer text on our final as an open-book test, and I ended up using a Schaums Heat Transfer book, as that book doesn't waste your time with derivations and isn't full of typos on key formulas and concepts.Schaum's Outline of Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition (Schaum's Outline Series)"

That\'s not so bad, though.The fabric is the big problem. It is silky in the way a sleeping bag is, not like a smooth cotton-based fabric. The blank is very loud in motion with friction and has a rough synthetic texture.Other than that, the ""clover"" color I ordered is not the very light green as shown on Amazon, but a darker pea soup green. ""Puke green"", perhaps. I sent mine back within minutes of taking it out of the plastic bag.Might be a soft-enough servicable throw, but not for the price I paid.

It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] Needless to say, I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts. This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(I can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! They also shipped them seperately. A sign of inefficiecy, indeed. One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. I've decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again."

Nonetheless, I did not find ""Bad Dog"" to live up to its promise. I hate to say it but this book is no ""Bad Cat.""This latter used the natural expressions of felines and some candid photography to really make a witty little coffee table and gift book. ""Bad Dog"" tries to do the same but ultimately fails. It fails because it relies mainly on staged photos of dogs in silly costumes instead of on the natural expressiveness of canine faces and the wide varitey of breeds, not to mention the interesting places dogs end up.Yes, there are some cute costumes and some witty captions here, but on the whole, the book is only mildly amusing. I am afraid that I cannot recommend ""Bad Dog"" as a gift or even for one\'s own light perusal. If there comes a third volume in this series, we can hope it will be titled ""Bad Editor!"""
2207,0,"Bad Book: I will agree, these dogs were definitely overdressed. Almost every dog has on an outfit. 95% of the pages were either bathroom or sex jokes. These just weren't funny. There's even a picture of a dog peeing. Wow, hilarious. Glad I didn't buy this, I read it in the store. The captions aren't funny, the pictures aren't funny. It would be an insult to purchase this for a dog-lover. Unfortunately, since the size and format are the same, it leads one to believe that it's by the same author as Bad Cat, which was hilarious and worth multiple readings. This book is NOT by the same author."
2208,0,"A Bit Forced: While some of the images and quips are funny, many are too forced. There are a lot of 'dress up' dog pictures which is fine, but the little sayings underneith don't always work.I think the title of this book is very misleading. These dogs don't look 'bad' at all. Few if any are doing anything but posing for the photograph."
2209,0,"Tepid and uninspired: I'm not sure why, but for some reason this book just did little for me. Oh, there were a few chuckles, but very few, and no laugh out loud moments.I know the authors were trying to duplicate the success of another very similar book, and unfortunately they just don't capture the same hilarity.I read a copy of Bad Dog that I found at my library, and while it was worth a quick read I am glad I did not spend actual money on it.Here's to hoping the authors can find more success with Bad (insert some other animal here)."

Bad cat was easier on her eyes excet the word sh&t.;Perhaps teenagers wrote Bad dog in their bathroom at school. Too much toilet humor and just dogs in costumes or angry snarling at you. Misses the edge of Bad cat and not as clever. The jokes are not funny unless a dog on the beach saying ""oh I love the beach"" is funny.Other reviews here say this is great and fantastic.

A reviewer states that this miniseries runs 4 hours and forty minutes. On the back of the video cassette case, the running time is given as approximately 192 minutes. However, the actual running time of the tape I received (in a case without shrink wrap but with a proper-looking label on the cassette) was a little over two hours. Even at the length stated on the case, this edition cannot be the complete miniseries if the figure of 4h 40m is correct. And there\'s no telling where the Amazon figure of six hours comes from. My low rating for this item is due to the unsatisfactory length, not the entertainment value of the movie."

2244,0,Poor Copy: Very poor copy. I taped this same movie a few years ago and would have been better off making my own copy.
2245,0,"I MADE IT TO THE END!!: So---so---so---many people to keep track of.The only decent one out of the whole lot was HANK.The rest of the folks were very iffy, at best.I wanted to stop quite a few times---but---kept going on.It was an okay read----not great---not terrible."

It isn't that the pictures I saw were poor quality and out of focus, it was really all about Mickey Jones and a kind of boring travelogue that we watch when friends take a vacation - but this - just to use Dylan's name and The Band's name and see shadows of them as they fade in or out and what do we learn that most die hard Dylan fans don't know - nothing! [...] there are wonderful, interesting CDs and DVDs and books that are intellectually and emotionally stimulating and while they may not answer questions, they certainly provoke and disarm and display all the charm and hauteur and humor that Dylan possesses and projects. Just don't bother, please. [...]"
2248,0,"Stick with Tae Bo: This was the WORST tape I've ever gotten! The Tae Bo Live Series and original Advanced tape are far better workouts and more comprehensive than this. I agree that the double-time is way too fast and you simply don't get a workout from this.Tracy is terrible. She is annoying, her moves are basic and boring (think beginner's jazz class with box steps and grapevines). I do not recommend this to anyone looking for a good workout.Stick with TAE BO!!"
2249,0,"BOOOOOooooooooo: There is no fat blasting going on in the video whatsoever. This is the worst workout tape I have ever done. ""Master Blaster"" - which I thought would be a challenging strength and aerobic combo is acutally 30 minutes of upper body with weights. It was so easy I barely broke a sweat. The only lower body excercise was a couple of squats. There were fake breasts all over the tape, and when it was over I felt like I had wasted 30 min of my life. I had to do 2 more tapes after this one just to feel like I got a workout at all. very disappointing Billy! p.s. fat blaster plus was 30 min of floor aerobics. ok, some fun moves, but nothing special."
2250,0,"this video: Absolutely the worst video around! Where to begin...the tape is slow moving, boring and completely uninspiring. The background hooping and hollering is annoying, not to mention distracting. Billy Blanks offers suggestions on how your form should and should not look at exactly the same time when the camera is panning on one of the background exercisers. Plus, he likes to flex his muscles and say ""don\'t you want to look like this""? Blanks focuses only on the upper body. He only does one lower body exercise. The stretches are uninspiring. He gives little or no direction and periodically he likes to ask - how do you feel? The few times I have used the tape - I respond: ""Cheated!!!!""The Tracy York portion I have used once. While she tries to offer instructions, they are shotty at best. I ended up relying on her music and routines from my past exercise classes to use instead of hers. A complete waste of time. No sweat at all. But then, I am no fan of Crunch or of Billy Blanks"
2251,0,ok for variety: I agree with all the other reviews. The aerobics are even hardto follow for me a long time aerobicsiser. I do however like using theweight segment for a quick diverse workout.
2252,0,"Billy Blanks Bites/Tracy York Mambos: Billy Blanks has nothing constructive or intelligent to say during the entire course of this workout, and the cameraman is obviously enamoured with the girls that Billy surrounded himself with to perform and look pretty. He gives no clear instruction on how to do anything except suck in your stomach and breathe. He also doesn\'t do equal amounts of repetition on each side, so you\'re left feeling like you\'ve had an incomplete workout. The editing is HORRIBLE.The aerobics version is okay, but if you count the number of times Tracy says the word ""mambo,"" you will want to die. Better to turn the volume off on this one--best not to buy at all."
2253,0,"Billy is good, Tracy NOT: This tape is 2 workouts by 2 different people. First is Billy, who mostly does upper body work with handweights. He keeps mentioning to keep the stomach muscles tight throughout the workout, which I liked. His workout was easy to follow and do on a rug. The 2nd workout with Tracy is awful. I gave up trying to follow it. Forget about doing this on a rug because she includes slides & crossovers so you have to pivot your feet. The camera focuses on her upper torso so you miss the change in movements. I'll definitely buy another Billy tape, but will avoid anything with Tracy."
2254,0,"This tape was a waste of time and money!: After doing TAEBO basics for about 2 months, I was really looking forward to this tape, wow, what a let-down. Billy Blanks did do a good job with the toning section of the video, my muscles felt like they really got a good workout. The aerobics portion was really bad. Tracy Yorks went too quickly, with little explanation of what was going on, and the camera angles were terrible. The video was more like learning difficult dance steps than working out."
2255,0,I'm disappointed Billy!: This tape was a real disappointment to me. As a huge Billy Blanks fan I was expecting more. The filming was very poor and the tape was slow moving and boring. I only made it through it twice. The workout was okay but nothing spectacular. The aerobic segment was impossible for me to follow.
2256,0,"What a Waste!!!: This tape was a complete waste of money. The only reason I gave it 1 star was because I couldn't give it less. The toning section chose to work selective random muscle groups which you couldn't even follow, and the aerobics was (a) low impact for experienced exercisers, despite what they say; and (b) you couldn't even follow her ridiculous 1980's dance steps."
2257,0,"What what that?: Thank goodness I just rented this from the library and didn't waste any money on it.The warm up was inadequate. Billy Blanks didn't actually do any of the exercises. He just stood around looking at the ladies surrounding him.It was impossible to be in good form, especially important while lifting weights, and follow the tape. He doesn't say what is coming up next. You have to turn to see. By the time you figure it out, they are on to the next exercise.I made it through 10 minutes before I hit stop and rewound the tape. I just couldn't take it any more.Avoid this one!"
2258,0,DON'T BUY!!: I thought this video was a DEFINITE waste of money! The first party with Billy Blanks is a good arm workout but the second party with Tracy Yorks was absolutely TERRIBLE! Not only is she impossible to follow but the workout was NOT fun and if you expect it to be anything like Tae Bo like I myself expected you are dead wrong!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
2259,0,"One of the WORST Vidoes available: Very disappointing. Sickening actually, with the class doing one thing and Billy saying something else, every 6 seconds someone hoots or hollars, FOR GOD SAKE WOULD YOU JUST SHOW US THE MOVES AND SHUT UP ABOUT IT. Billy doesn't deliver much that's useful in this one. Steer clear!"
2260,0,"This is probably the WORST tape I own: I bought this tape because I figured that since Billy Blanks is like the Barbra Streisand of workout videos that this tape would deliver. I WAS SO WRONG! First half the time I couldn't understand his workout instructions, then when I could understand what he was saying the people in the video were doing something else.This is a dreadful workout tape, and I would not reccomend it to anyone for toning. It's too fast to get a proper contraction, and not only that you wait for it to be over.DON'T BUY IT! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!"
2261,0,"What ""riot?"": Ok the first half of the video is from a rarely seen live concert from the \'88 Suffer tour. The sound quality is poor , but it\'s still cool..HOWEVER..the supposed infamous riot footage on the second half is nothing more but 30 minutes of filming broken glass and firetrucks..we don\'t see the actual rioting at all...NONE....the movie package misleads by saying "" SEE THE RIOT IN IT\'S ENTIRITY FROM FIRST BEER BOTTLE THROWN TO THE LAST , THE THROWING ROCKS , ect"" ...none of this is seen.we see the footage where the promotor shuts the show down because the fire marshall thought it was too overcrowded....but no actual rioting..just 30 minutes of boring footage of broken glass...what a waste of [money]....don\'t buy it ....don\'t waste your money....I only gave it 2 stars for the concert in the first half.."
2262,0,"What were they thinking: Picture yourself standing behind a pole watching a concert. You would have been better off that the view you get from this video. I can't believe the Bad Religion boys would put out junk like this. The audio and video quality is terrible, absolutely terrible.There are plenty of songs to see them perform live, but your only perspective is off the stage to the left with a tiny camera held in someones hand. Don't waste your money on this."

2265,0,"They sound like a bad cover-band: I heard them on Howard Stern and loved the acoustic versions of the songs. I thought that is what would be on the CD. Well, it's not. What is on the CD just sounds like watered down versions of the real songs. Also, it sounds like it was mixed poorly. Overall, a very bad album."

He being of the band that brought you Sister Christian and Rock in America staples of marginal 80's rock. (The B in Blades is for boring) But Shaw is very disappointing. I expected more. He should dump that anchor Jack Blades and find his inner musician again.Forget the Pepsi commercial. Next up, Shaw Blades remakes David Lee Roth!"

2273,0,"Grill This Loser: Time to review the 1992 crime drama ""Sunset Grill"" starring Peter Weller and Lori Sanger. The letterbox states, ""For years private eye Ryder Hart lived on the edge. Tonight he\'ll cross the line.""Well...Ryder (Weller) crosses the line and in the process we\'re all witnesses to one of the most boring crime flicks on Planet Earth.Peter Weller walks around for 90 minutes beat-up, bruised and bleeding like a mutt that\'s just been run over by a semi.Lori Sanger looks like a wax mannequin at Tussaud\'s House of Horrors and her acting could be recreated in any viable sound software program.Grill this one at sunset. I mean (to get to the point)...take the DVD and throw it into your barbecue grill as a flame starter.Peter, whom I admired prior to this embarrassment, is no longer a ""Weller"" in my book...he\'s now a ""Worser""."
2274,0,"Not in agreement with other reviewers: I read the first 40 pages to verify my initial reaction toward this book: namely, the author is pompous and patronizing to his audience. He treats his readers as though they have few brain cells. Moreover, he frequently mentions the word ""ego"" as if this is the primary reason why people enter consulting (i.e., to feed theirs). It\'s certainly not mine. After reading to page 40, I jumped ahead to Chapter 8, Establishing Fees, which provided useful information. I plan to move on to other books that are outside the box re: consulting...and that don\'t insult my intelligence."
2275,0,"I don\'t understand why this is a highly rated book: I didn\'t like the book. It doesn\'t have much to do with consulting. It is teaching about how to sell, how to register a company and similar pretty common stuff.The book is missing the consulting essentials - some tools, how to build and defend a workshop, some blueprint examples for different situations, approaches to strategic and ""tactical"" consulting respectively... In the same time it is handling some micro processes on a ""how to give a smile"" level and giving some advices as ""you should have a web site"". Wow. I just didn\'t find the value."
2276,0,"Very basic: There\'s a great chapter on setting your fees based on value, rather than hourly rates. Its the only reason I kept the book. (Although if I had known that was the only worth this book contained for me, I would have bought Weiss\'s ""value based fees."")But hey -- if you don\'t already know that maybe you want a photocopier; or that clients are more impressed by good logos than by bad logos; or that you shouldn\'t go around working for free; then this is the book for you."
2277,0,"Needs Professional Editing: I'm new to telecom and I needed a comprehensive but easy to read book. This wasn't a good choice.The book does have a good glossary. However, after the first few pages the authors suddenly start tossing around acronyms as if everyone innately understands them.But worse by far is that paragraphs are out of sequence. You have to figure out for yourself that the paragraph you are reading is related to three paragraphs back but not the immediately preceding paragraphs. I found this very distracting and unpleasant and I really wished the authors had invested in editing services. You can piece together the logic but you have to be a pretty brave soul to take on a new, technical subject, a rather dry one at that, with a book that isn't strong on logical editorial flow.I wouldn't recommend this book except perhaps to someone already familiar enough with the material that the literary weaknesses don't hinder study."
2278,0,"Ouch!!!: This one hurts. I loved Bombs Over Broadway and their self-titled release. I even enjoyed their old ska/punk styled albums, but this one is really a dissapointment. Now signed to Capitol, have Squad sold out? I asked Jeff, the lead singer of Squad, ""what happened to you guys, I listened to the album and it wasn\'t very good."" He said, and I quote, ""We tried mixing the Clash with the Stones, but listen to it, you\'ll get used to it. We had to listen to it a couple times before we liked it too.""Okay so if the band has to get used to their own stuff, I think we have a problem on hand."

2283,0,"Visually splendid but weakly informative: I absolutely concur with the gentleman who reviewed this DVD on Feb. 28. The footage is outstanding, and I have not seen a majority of it in any other documentary. However, I expected to see some unbelievable documentary about the Apollo program. Instead, the DVD shows what it looks like to go to the moon. This is done by taking various films of different missions and splicing them together though out of context/sequence. Again, this is beautifully done, but it does not tell you anything. This DVD is to be enjoyed if you have a good knowledge of the space program and want to watch some unseen or rare footage. But if you want to learn about the actual space and/or Apollo program, look for documentaries elsewhere. You won't find anything knew in this documentary other then the beautiful visual images."

2285,0,Criterion mutilation of a classic space journey experience!: ...read the reviews with interest - but frankly I was gutted to discover that Criterion have 'mutilated' this superb doc by messing with the original score/arrangements.'Deep blue Day' by Brian Eno and intermittant musical inserts lasting only a view seconds (which previously transported the viewer away from the immediate scene with the Astronauts) have all been removed - the magic has been squeezed out of this classic piece of video/doc architecture by a company who have done the equivalent of a painting a moustache on a classic oil with a black felt tip pin!Please cure my depression with some info on how I can get my hands on the original classic version on DVD or VHS?

2286,0,"Good headphones but not for noise canceling: I rated these 1 star because they did not satisfy the reason I purchased them ... primarily to cancel out engine noise while flying. While they do give you decent sound from your music device, the open-ear design pretty much negates the noise canceling function. I have owned noise-canceling headphones before, Sony. These were closed ear design and did a much better job of canceling engine drone and other low frequencies, tho I had the same annoying problem with crackling and popping when I moved that everyone else seems to have experienced. Bottomline, do not purchase these if your goal is to reduce air travel noise."
2287,0,"Problem With Noise Cancellation Feature: The only reason for my purchase of the Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones was to cancel noise not listen to music, etc. The person that I purchased them for is writing a technical book and relative silence is an important part of the writing process. Unfortunately, the normal surrounding noise was not canceled and, therefore, it was necessary to return the headphones. Please note, the other features of the headphones appeared to be fine. As of 15 August I have not heard anything about a refund, but am confident that will be properly handled by Amazon. I have made several purchases from Amazon and until this one have always been very satisfied with them. I look forward to a continuing relationship."
2288,0,Do not Buy this item if you are planning to use to cancel work conversation: I bought this with trhe impression that it will cancel out work conversation. I am still able to hear the work conversation without any noise being cancelled out even though I have noise cancellation on. The people at work just go on talking as if there is no tomorrow. But this item is no good.
2289,0,"Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones: I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase. I'm not an audiophile or a technical expert on this item but I have good hearing, I know what I like and I'm totally satisfied with these noise cancelling headphones. They're easy to use, fold up neatly for travel and the noise cancellation is amazing.The active electronics are in a separate unit which also holds the batteries. This tends to mean the wires can get a little tangled but this is not a serious drawback. This is an excellent product. If I were to lose this headset, I'd buy the same model as a replacement."
2290,0,"Uncomfortable, awkward, noise cancelling just OK: I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my Etymotic ER4 earbuds, which were a replacement for my Sony MDR-NC10 earbuds. Unfortunately, I found them much less comfortable than either the Etymotic or the Sony earbuds and no better at noise canceling.I have used headphones two hours every day for the past twelve years during my train commute. I have been through a long succession of iPods and portable FM radios. I have had a lot of time (too much really) to develop an opinion. I am sticking with the Etymotic earbuds.BTW, the Sony earbuds were great, but if you lose one of the rubber earpieces (like I did - twice) Sony dings you for about $40 for a replacement."
2291,0,"Buy the Bose QC-3's instead: Bought these, tried them at home and was not impressed with the sound quality for being a Sennheiser model. Know that I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to sound quality, but I thought the noise-cancelling feature was more of a weak sound boost and the large noise-cancelling microphone was awkwardly placed halfway down the cord.I returned these and went back to the Bose store and purchased the QC-3's, which sound much better (clearer highs and deeper lows), have a more comfortable fit, have a built in noise-canceling microphone and a rechargeable battery. Yes, the Sennheisers are almost 1/3 the price of the Bose set, but if you're serious about sound quality and appreciate well designed functionality, then trust me, just get the Bose set - you won't regret it."
2292,0,Not as good as I expected: Pro:It does eliminate the fan noise from the desktop computer. That's all it can.Con:It has its own low freq. noise when the cancel. is not activated.
2293,0,"Awful: I own the Bose QC2. The QC2 sounds great, but they are big and carry-on space is always at a premium. I wanted to try the smaller Sennheiser 300\'s. They are smaller, but they do not do a good job of cancelling out the noise. The right side was particularly bad. It seemed that the noise of the engines ""leaked"" through. I recommend avoiding these."
2294,0,"decent while they lasted, but poorly built: I enjoyed these headphones for the noise cancellation on long flights, but they are made of cheap plastic and did not hold up well over time. After one year, the the pretty silver pieces on the backs of the earcups came off. A few months later, one of the tiny plastic tabs holding the battery cover in place broke off, so I had to tape the battery case shut. And a few months after that, the rubber insulation pulled away from the jack at the joint, exposing the wires. I wrapped the frayed joint with electrical tape to keep them working a while longer, but on my last flight they finally stopped transmitting sound. The noise reduction still works, but who cares? For the price, they should be made with better materials."

Had to replace a few cards ( MS & SMC work & can be found cheap )4. the wireless connection seems to slow to a halt... you can still pull an ip and browse the internet (at circa 2400 baud speeds)... a reset of the unit fixes this momentarily, but considering you have to either a) walk to the unit and push a button or b) slowly load it's config page and do it -- it's not worth the hassle.Do like me and buy something else... something with all good reviews."

2299,0,"The worst Rypdal disc by far!: I\'ve always been of an opinion that Terje Rypdal is a much better backing guitarist in other people\'s bands than he is a leader and a composer.His compositions on the ""Chaser"" disc are chaotic and completely lacking any kind of substance. I could hardly get to the end of the CD. I was bored to death.In general, the drummer Audun Kleive did a hell of lot better job than the leader.BTW, I recommend another disc with Rypdal on a guitar: ""Nordic Quartet"" where he plays with SURMAN, KROG and STORAS. If you like a bit more serious Euro-jazz, listen to ""Litania"" by TOMASZ STANKO. Terje has a couple of great moments on that record."
2300,0,bicycle board games: The game has great graphics but cheats like no body's business. Just when you are ahead the computer will make you loose. It will always roll whatever number on the dice it needs and you can bet the bank you won't. It also has some minor problems that cause some irratation. The old man will say gross things if you are playing as the little girl. I felt the need to turn off the sound it was so gross.

What I mean is no matter how many new games you start you always seem to be the last one out of the gate while the other players are well past the start. You would think with an AI it would be like a man that has stragity, but its really if 'x' ='s Y, then it shows you z. For all the possible rolls it says you must have this. Not only does this happen on cross and circles, but on the backgammon board as well. No matter what you roll the computer player always gets a higher number and starts first. Real life my a$$.This of course goes for the chess game as well. Except maybe for random settings; it is possible to memorize the settings as the program only moves a certian way once you do it. Memorize the moves in chess and you can win every time."

The characters (with a few minor exceptions) seem trapped by expectations. I grant you it's set in a repressed time, but still, I was hoping, until the bitter end, for a flash of life. Somewhere.And I am not a romance reader, so that's not what I was looking for.... Just a small spark of life.A pretty disappointing read, in my view."
2306,0,"A Disappointment: As I read these other reviews I\'m curious if they were reading the same book that I read. I gave it 2 stars only because I have read worse books. That is not to say that the information in the book is not interesting, or heartfelt, but I just feel poorly written. Dirlam repeats herself in many useless issues, such as the numerous times that she metions the reavealing dress of the russian girls. The book is also a bit scattered, it did not flow well.

2311,0,"Save a tree and put your money in the alms basin: Amen to the first reviewer. This book is awful, a poorly written attempt to sugarcoat a grand idea with fundimental propaganda. John was a wonderful man, the beloved. In this book he is a cardboard comic book character. Thank heaven it is fiction, and a good thing the last half is the Gospel and writings of John otherwise I could never finish it. Give alms to the poor but don't waste your money on this commercial pulp paper."
2312,0,"HORRIBLE: First, understand that I am a fan of the Left Behind series. I found it a little long (I mean really, 12 books? C'mon) but it was compelling overall.I looked forward to what LaHaye and Jenkins would do with the Gospels. Well....they've done nothing. NOTHING. Nada. Zip. Zilch. There's almost no background of John, his associates in later life, his time with Jesus, nothing. All they've done is basically taken dictation from John word for word, with a little tension thrown in. This is the biggest money grab I've seen in a long time. These two are capitalizing on their fame by scamming fans. They should be ashamed.Save yourself some time and money. Buy a Bible. Read the Gospel of John (and everything else in it, for that matter). It's better than this book can ever hope to be."
2313,0,"disappointing: I\'ve read all the Left Behind books, and have to agree with the other reviewers here. This book was a real disappointment. They make John sound more like an Earl in England than a person in Rome 95 AD. There appears to be a great deal of ""poetic license"" taken in this book, and unfortunately, it is not that entertaining or insightful. ZZZZzzzzzzz."
2314,0,"Only the original artist.: I listened to my Mel McDaniels tapes for years and wanted to upgrade to CD, But these sound nothing like the original songs."
2315,0,"Very disapointed!!!!: I got these tweezers because I was very happy with my previous tweezerman for many years (but I lost it). When this one arrived it looked just great until I tryed doing my eyebrows. Instead of pulling the hair out, the edges are so sharp that they just pinch the hair off. It has been a great annoyance!!! Only 1 out of every three hairs actually comes out, the rest get pinched off and stay in leaving a short black stump. To even try to pull out the stump again you have to wait till it grows out a bit. Very disapointed!!!!"
2316,0,Defective Purchase: The tweezer heads didn't align and couldn't grip anything. Will probably think twice about buying tweezers before I can make sure they close correctly.
2317,0,Don't waste your money: Usually I feel safe buying Tweezerman brand. These feel like some generic knock off - they don't work well and are super stiff to use. I had to go buy a new pair at the beauty supply!
2318,0,didnt last too long: I only had a few uses out of it and already weak? Not worth buying. Get the original @ the store
2319,0,"not happy: This tool comes wtih it's own plastic case, which helps for carrying in purses. However, it doesn't work very well. Many times it misses hairs, especially the lighter, thinner ones and it's also not nearly as comfortable to use as a regular-sized pair of tweezers."
2320,0,Not up to par with the full size model: It cuts or breaks hairs making them impossible to remove. I've used the full size model for years and have been very satisfied with it. I guess that I should stick with a known winner.
2321,0,"Too heavy: I bought these tweezers based on the awesome reviews. When I tried them, I found that they were so heavy, and the edge so sharp that it cut every eyebrow hair at the base, instead of pulling them out by the root. Make sure to pluck veryyyyy slowly, if you slip and grab a bit of you skin, you will get cut for sure. I had to run to the store to buy different tweezers."
2322,0,"Very dry & theoretical: I\'m amazed that this book has received so many great reviews, when I\'ve found it extremely dry and theoretical. It seems more like a not very engaging textbook than a resource for working development professionals. It becomes more interesting when Ms. Grace uses occasional real-world examples -- and if she decides to write a 3rd edition I\'d strongly recommend she use an editor who can translate her concepts into a more reader-friendly style. I\'m a graduate of an Ivy-level school so I\'m not asking her to ""dumb it down"" -- just don\'t write in the style of an academic thesis. At least one reviewer noted that Ms. Grace is a warm individual, which leads me to believe that this person has attended her workshops. While she may be an excellent in-person presenter, much seems to have been lost in the writing process, as I didn\'t sense any warmth or personality in this book. I will continue to read the book to the end, and hope that it somehow gets better."
2323,0,Not sure how I feel.: I ordered this book and it had a nice looking cover on the picture when I placed the order and when I received the book it is just a black cover. I wish it would have said in the listing that there was no cover for this book. I'm hoping it is the right book for my daughters class as I won't be able to find out until she is back at school and already is in need of the book. I picked this store due to its high 100% rating and right now I'm not sure if the rating was right. I think it needs to be disclosed you are buying a book without the cover on it. So I will have to wait and see how the out come turns out for this purchase before I make a final decision on this.
2324,0,Book received with no cover: I received the book in pretty good condition however it did not have the cover on it which was disappointing because in the picture it had the cover. I am not sure if there is any way to get the cover however if so I would like to have it. Thank you!
2325,0,"B-movie!: A lot of cable stations play substandard flicks like this when they don\'t show the good stuff. This movie has the predictable chase scene, the predictible kidnapping, and the predictible boudoir action. If you loved seeing Michael Rooker and his basement in ""Mallrats,"" you\'ll like seeing him and his basement here. This time, he has cranial hair and it looks great on him. Don\'t get me wrong: some will like this flick. Still, many will see that it\'s the same ol\', same ol\'. It is just basically nothing to write home about. It\'s not despicable, but it\'s not praiseworthy either."
2326,0,"Nice if you want to learn tips&tricks and nothing more: This is 5 stars if you want to learn only tips&tricks; an learn nothing about assembly. After you read this book you know how to write to files in assembly, how to paint a image on the screen....However this 'master class' learn you nearly nothing about assembly programming. It's just a tips&tricks; book. In a tips&tricks; world you don't survive, because your tips will be soon obsolete. You can better learn the ideas behind the tips. You do need to have a great insight in the fundamentals. With fundamentals I mean: how to make and call procedures. How to pass parameters to procedures in assembly, how are instructions processed by the processors etc.If you're looking for fundamentals in low level programming I would recommend 'Assembly Language and Computer Architecture Using C++ and Java' bij Mr. Reis (ISBN 0534405274)."
2327,0,"waaaaaayyyyyy smaller than advertised: Just received this bag for my very slightly taller than average three year old, and there is no way he will be able to use it. This bag is advertise as being 50"" long, and he is only 39"" tall and it is way too short for him. I will be returning this asap. I have no idea how on earth they measured 50"", but it most definitely is not. I would say that a much shorter than average two year old could possibly use it for one season, but no longer than that. Don\'t waste your money on this bag."
2328,0,"Change not for the better: I was very disappointed in the product. This was a product I used for years and my last three cans were terrible. it no longer mixes well and it has a very gritty consistency. The taste too has changed, I will no long be buying Peaceful Planet Soy Protein Powder again."
2329,0,"SOPHOMORIC FANTASY PRETENDING TO BE SF: I\'ve read many teenager\'s fantasies as good as this. The silly, formal and archaic \'fantasy\' diction is here all right: ""Yes, Milady,"" etc. etc.So to, is the ridiculous chivalry, the bows, the costumes, the sweet young thing with tresses aglow. Oi.I know every writer has to start somewhere, but must their childish scribblings be published? Must every writer who makes a name for himself go back and sell every word he\'s ever written, cashing in on his name? Have they no shame?"
2330,0,STAY AWAY THIS SEAT IS DANGEROUS: The foam padding inside this seat turned into a black powder within 4 months. I tried contacting combi but they don't have an email address listed and when you call the 1800 number your call never gets through to a person or an answering service. I would like to give Amazon 5 stars for taking the item back when I contacted them and giving me back 100% refund including the shipping. I just don't agree with them for continuing to sell this dangerous product. The black power that the foam in this seat turns into could easily be swallowed by a young child and could cause serious medical problems. I have also reported this to the NTSB.
2331,0,"Poor writing style defeats the message: This book has some interesting content, nothing new standard new age metaphysics, but it is, without doubt, the worst written book I\'ve ever read. It has the tons of repetition, so much that you don\'t see what\'s new in the repetitions. Curious use of words. There is a long explanation of ""paradigm"" then the word is misused.... defeating the purpose of all the preparatory pages. If this was edited down to 10 or 20 pages it would be worth reading, but needs the work of a professional editor. But there is not enough content for the effort."
2332,0,"An introduction to pseudoscience: This book belongs in the category of books about mysterious ""energy fields"", tachyons, and tangential vortex amplifiers. That category is pseudoscience. The author also misrepresents quantum theory.-A physicist"
2333,0,"A technical disappointment: The CD version of this book is very easy to use and the search function is wonderful. HOWEVER there is no way to copy text off the screen so you can paste it into other applications. I find this very frustrating and a big disappointment.The CD version of ""The Voyage of the Beagle"" suffers from the same problem. Beware."
2334,0,"Needing a magnifying glass: Was disappointed when I opened the book to see the extremely small print - never have worn glasses and great vision, but what I'm sure was going to be a deliciously meaty book, full of Darwin's views and where they stem from, has become a book that is passed over for something more traditional in size and font.Maybe I should have read the reviews or book into closer and would have noticed this was mentioned.Oh well, someday I'll get to it...once I find my magnifying glass!Smalls"
2335,0,"Astonishing Mistake!: Darwin never wrote a book titled 'The origin of the species'. His bookwas published under two titles: 'The origin of species', and 'On the origin ofspecies'. Both also had subtitles. The term `the species' has sometimes beenused by creationists as a synonym for `human beings', and they incorrectlyrefer to Darwin's book as `The origin of the species', implying that it isabout the origin of humans. Of course, it is not. It is about the origin ofspecies - duh. Publishing a book with this incorrect title helps support the creationists' misrepresentation of Darwin. Amazon should not sell this book unless thetitle is corrected."
2336,0,"Too outdated: Many people don't realize that there are many flaws with the theory of evolution. And that Darwin was not in fact a naturalist on the Beagle...BUT the captain's companion. In addition to that we have found NO evidance of one species evolving to another.A creature such as Homohabilus is actually thought to be a combination of other bones put together...meaning that it is not real. It is a made-up creature that people have made themselves believe real to support their ideas without actual scientific evidence.I believe that Darwin's theory is wonderful, but people have to be more open-minded and not believe everything they read or hear."
2337,0,"Good sound, comfortable, Broken after 1 month.: I bought these after shopping around a bunch. I loved them and used them all the time. For a month that is.Today when I was taking them off the center of the plastic behind the neck part snapped in two. If you are going to make a product that gets flexed in normal use, it better stand up to it.Oh well, guess I will get some sony's, I had my last pair of them till the foam ear covers wore away."
2338,0,"Complete lack of quality: Logitech has done it again. They lured me in with something shiney at a low price point and I took the bait, hook line and sinker. These are the worst quality headphones I've owned since my sony walkman replacement fuzzies way back in the early 80s. The sound is small and easily distorted and they are an engineering disaster.These headphones use a clear plastic strap to keep tension on the ears holding the speakers on your head. This is not only seriously uncomfortable but after a week of use, my headphones are completely and cleanly broken in two!Logitech, which used to be, and still is in some unenlightened circles, the industry standard, has removed all quality from their products, and these trendy headphones are a sterling example of this. I could pursue the warranty, but at under $10 I'm just going to call it a wash and lesson learned...again."
2339,0,"Yes, Read the whole thing!: I don\'t see how you can isolate ""The Grand Inquisitor"" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov. I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!! My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this. It\'s excellent."
2340,0,"A strange concept.: How would it have been if Christ had shown up at the Spanish Inquisition?This has interesting possibilities but, it was not really developed to its full potential."
2341,0,Stink Bomb: This is easily the worst of the three albums these guys have. Pick up the other ones if you want to hear some quality western harmony rockabilly.
2342,0,"Mediocre: Some of the insights seemed interesting, but the author seems to have difficulty focusing on what it is, he's actually doing/ writing about.Book goes back and forth and never seems to develop a solid purpose. Plus it needed to be proofread and seriously edited."
2343,0,"Pretty Sad: I read this book and it was extremely boring. The author enjoys talking about himself, most of which is uninteresting. He enjoys talking about his swimming in the waters naked. Yuck!"
2344,0,"What about hexane?: Martek Labs supposedly processes the algae with the toxic, petro-chemical based hexane. Because no residue is left, they don't have to list it, but it's nasty stuff. Read the Cornucopia Institute's report on soy and see the reference to algae-based DHA. I'm trying to find other brands that don't use hexane."
2345,0,"Ingredients have changed!!!: What amazon is showing is what it used to be and what my son used to like. Before it was very clear capsule w/ 5 other ingredients you can readily identify. (sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, water, vita C, and vita E. I used to order 1 bottle every 2 months for my son and he used to like simple seaweed flavor. Now it has modified corn starch, glycerin, high oleic sunflower oil, purified water, CARRAGEENAN, sorbitol, ascorbyl palmitate, tocopherols, natural flavor, sunflower lecithin, and caramel. Now it has stronger odor, smaller but thicker shell, and dark brown in color from its original clear orange color. My son won't touch this thing anymore. I guess they changed the formula to decrease the volume and lower the cost. Time to look for another brand."
2346,0,Pathetic And Passe: This is a Sad attempt at turning a dollar I purchased this book in the attempt to learn something about the Gothic Culture but as it turns out it is nothing but Self Righteous people creating an alternate life to escape thier mundane lives.
2347,0,"Immigrant Kids: This author's over-reliance on historic photographs -- without any explanation about how the photos were taken, used and then later retrieved -- is very confusing to well-intentioned history students."
2348,0,"Filled with bugs: This game has so many bugs in it I need to buy Raid!! The game loses the face/name of individual players on a regular basis, it locks up on Pai Gow, when playing craps in the challenge round it fails to recognize when someone runs out of money and you have to forfeit the challenge, and these are just a few of the problems with this game. I usually buy Hoyle but we decided to try this one instead...what a mistake. We have version 2.0 but will probably look to buy the Hoyle game instead. Typical Microsoft product...market it before you get it running!"
2349,0,Disappointed: I had the old game and love playing it but the new game is not as fun and I do not play it as much.
2350,0,"falling off Bicycle Games: Don't buy this bug ridden piece of dung, I bought the so called updated 2004 version. It crashes randomly at every turn, stats don't record right, the computer AI miss reads your hands not giving you credit for hands won. Its all around terribly buggy. Its been out for months and they still stock on shelfs all around the country even though its known to have major problems. They don't intend to fix anything, Activison is making a quick buck by repackaging an old game 2001 Bicycle from Microsoft, adding one or two new features and calling brand new for 2004, and in the process making totally unplayable. With the stores policy of not excepting open software you are stuck with it if you buy it,they are afraid of piracy. well Activision is the party guilty of piracy here in the form of robbing us all.STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS."

2352,0,"2 stars - for only 2 songs: 2 stars for 2 songs: ""Summer breezin"" and ""sugar sugar"" are really convincing and quite up to the level of her first hit ""shy guy"". The rest of the album is ok, but not very spectacular and rather boring to my ears."
2353,0,"Some interesting info but disappointing: The beginning of the book has some interesting concepts which are unfortunately underdeveloped in the book. The focus seems to be on highly paranoid individuals, their symptoms, and examples of them. The later part of the book merely rattles off stories of notable people without fully discussing the paranoid features. Additionally, the typos and writing style lead me to think that there was little care put forth in producing this book.I bought this book for the purposes of finding out more about paranoia because some people close to me are sufferers. This book did not help me in my quest for more insightful information."
2354,0,"Too Bad: Certainly one of the most puerile, self-serving, and monotonous uses to which words have ever been put.Go back to your lit crit day job, Mr. Lentricchia. There's no future for you in real writing!"
2355,0,"junk: They say it works for infants, but without having to rig something to get it reclined enough, it doesn't. Yeah, some other reviewers mentioned that you can put something under it to recline it more, but the point is that you shouldn't have to.Don't buy this garbage."
2356,0,"Do not buy :(: I did a lot a research prior to purchasing this car seat. At first when my son was just transitioning to the convertible seat this carseat was fine, except for it was VERY VERY hard to install (no matter what car/suv)As my son has grown he has quickly become to big. The straps are too short and they pinch him. He head piece is hard to adjust as well. I do like the color and the fabric has worn well. Overall I wish I had bought another car seat."
2357,0,"Should have listened to the bad reviews: I really hate this after using the one we bought from Costco.We had read the review about some good points being safe andable to sleep well. Well, with our Honda Pilot, that chairsimple cannot be reclined any bit for any comfort. And tryingto download instructions is a joke. It is so difficult and complicatedto use, I will NEVER recommend this to anyone other than an enemy.Our baby did not like it either, and the latch is so sharp I almostcut myself trying to unhook it to change to forward position (finally!)It is very user friendly, unless you have a person dedicated totaking care of your baby and is mechanically inclined, don't bother.Single moms should really stay away from this unless you haveall the time and resources in the world. I am sorry to soundso frustrated, but I am. It might be safe, but very difficult touse."
2358,0,"Believe those who say it's a pain: For all of the reviews that said this car seat was a pain to work with, we thought we'd give it a try. After all, it is very highly rated for safety. Well, believe those reviews. I would rather have spent the extra money for an easier car seat to deal with.We should have known better when the fireman at the free car seat check-up/installation took one look and groaned."
2359,0,"Death of a Schulze: The introduction of digital technology into the hands of Klaus Schulze has led to a musical drought that has lasted almost the entirity of his career (with the exception of the fantastic Dark Side of the Moog series). The huge, spacious, warm, and ethereal sound of his classic period were gone with the introduction of this album, and in their place we find dull, flat instrumentation and painfully cheesy solos. In essense, all the horrid 1980's instrumentation our modern ears have learned to despise are packed into this album, creating a landscape of neon and bad hair. The only listenable track is Death of an Analogue, which comes across like a funeral march, but with an eerie vocoder thrown in. But that's not enough to redeem what is one of Schulze's worst albums."
2360,0,They keep bringing it!: If you thought that the amazing sounds comming from Ohm's studio work was due to 'studio' work well guess again! These guys have brought it to the house in their 'live' format this time. The craftmanship these guys display is wonderful. Everytime I listen I am amazed at the musicianship. They have just raised the bar for three piece bands by quite a few notches. What a band!
2361,0,Good Idea that Didn't Pan Out: I got this album after hearing Jorge Ben's great music on Africa Brasil. I checked around and read that this was a good one to get. I've got to say that I was disappointed. It all just sounds a bit off. The singing is slightly out of tune enough to drive you crazy and the music never really takes off like I had read it would. Try Africa Brasil for a real taste of Jorge Ben or Tropicalia 2 if you are looking for Gilberto Gil.
2362,0,a true throwaway effort: so i did. out the window one night. absolutely unlistenable. way too indulgent. [and i really like Gil].
2363,0,"Tie strap is worthless!!!: It might be a nice computer but the specialized tie strap that holds the magnetic pick up is unbelievably brittle.

2366,0,below average: I agree with the above. This book is more about miller than Ali. This was one big ego trip for the author
2367,0,"Deceptive Title + Poor Writing = DO NOT BUY.: It bothers me to think how much money Mr. Miller and his publishers have made from this lame effort with a grossly misleading title.Firstly, this book is as much if not more so about Mr. Miller rather than exclusively about Mr. Ali. I purchased this hoping to read about Mr. Ali, the name in the title, NOT Mr. Miller; I have zero interest in hearing his life story. A completely misleading title in that respect, to be sure...Secondly, the concept that is implied in the title is that the reader will be exposed to the Tao essence of Mr. Ali. Personally I found far too little of this in the writing, so I would say the title is misleading on this account.Finally, I found Mr. Miller's style irritating to the point of distraction. If you are in search of a very poor Norman Mailer retread, you will disagree with me."
2368,0,Waste of money at ANY price!: I bought this flashlight an used it a few times and a few times is all it can be used. I hadn't picked it up in a couple of months and when I tried to use it I could not get it to turn on. Lousy product.
2369,0,"Save your money, go with Maglite: I have owned many flashlights and the Smith and Wesson design is terrible. Every Maglite that I have owned, in all sizes, have always performed well - buy Maglite. This S&W light drained batteries when off. Even worse, the design means that the front end twists more easily than the lens cover or the battery compartment covers. As a consequence, the wires inside get twisted and break because of inappropriate twisting and the flashlight is rendered useless without a solder repair of the wires. Save you money, do not buy S&W flashlight."
2370,0,"Save Your Money - Buy a Surefire or MagLite: I don't usually write reviews, but this product is so bad that I wanted to warn others. I own many fine flashlights, and I am afraid this is not one of them. First, the flashlight drains batteries even when it is off. I wrote to Smith and Wesson, and they referred me to the company that produces the flashlights for them, Powertech. Powertech will not respond to e-mails/voicemails. Even with new batteries, the light from the 3 white LED's is inadequate (I would say it is around 15 lumens or so at best), and the UV beam is even weaker. Would be good for detailed work (up close hobbies and the like) but completely inadequate outdoors for hunting and tracking purposes. For the same price, the new 3 watt LED mini-mag lite is a suprisingly good option. It has a powerful beam that can be focused. My advice would be to spend $10 bucks more and get a Surefire G2 Nitrolon. This is a horrible product, and I would strongly advise against purchasing it."
2371,0,"made in china: I am very disappointed with my flashlight. Yes, it works fine. Yes, it fits the description about the product. But I truly thought that, being a Smith & Wesson, it would be made in USA and therefore would not be lacking most of the quality reassurance and labor standards that make a product worth to buy. I will NOT buy any more S&W products. Amazon should make a better effort to inform the manufacturing origin of the products it sells."

Ms. Lane spends practically less than a minute on each step and it's variations...and the entire sixties section barely lasts eight minutes. For twenty dollars this dvd might be worth it - but for the price, the silly production values, and the fact there is so little actual material here... it's insanely overpriced."

2378,0,"Buyer beware: I bought this book, used, from a link to the 2009 edition and they sent me a copy from 1974. Double check what you are buying because I'm pretty sure the 1974 edition is essentially worthless to me since nursing practice has changed a little bit in the last 40 years."
2379,0,Nursing book: I was disappointed in this product in that it didn't show the date of the book. To find out the book was printed in the 70's.It was cool to look at but the seller needs to show the date of the book. I was looking for a newer version.

2381,0,"What a JOKE!: This book was given to me by a friend, and as I read it I became more and more curious why someone would even write a book with titles like: Marilyn: Money Mixed with SEX?This book is an unhappy compilation of people who are focused on money and the happiness it should be bringing them. They seem clueless that the lack of Jesus in their lives is the reason why they cannot get over their addictions to money.This is a very Catholic book about trying to make oneself feel better about having a large sum of money. The book examines such queer questions such as(page 218), ""What is the deepest calling you can hear about the sacred potential about money in your life"".This author needs to get a life."
2382,0,"A novel for die-hard Hardy fans and academics: Ethelberta is not a book I would recommend to most people, and certainly not to someone who has never read Hardy. The novel is tediously written and lacks the depth pervasive in other works set in the country. Only in the last hundred or so pages did the story become engrossing. Why then did I continue reading? Deriving some measure of enjoyment from this book requires that the reader look at it as an example of Hardy's development as an author. The scholarly introduction and notes provide explanations that help with this analysis and make the novel more interesting."

Helen Fisher puts on her estrogenial klan hat and takes ridiculous stabs at the male population in a flurry of one sided hilarity, buy this book if you want a laugh or are insecure in your femininity and need an fantasy shot, otherwise steer FAR AWAY from this title. personally, I felt dirty after reading this book, I boiled myself in a giant pot of water to cleanse the perpetuated filth"
2392,0,"wrong approach causes Ms Fisher to fall flat on her face.: I have to admire what Ms. Fisher was trying to do. Just before this book was released a lot of women magazines ran short articles about the superiority of women that had some men sort of worried. However, when the book was published the guys took a great sigh of relief. Bascially, Ms. Fisher went about it all the wrong way and ended up writing a book that\'s really nothing more than a bunch of wishful thinking on her part. Fisher states a lot of things that had me saying ""okay, that may be true, now back it up with the facts."" If you\'re interesting in this sort of topic (and you should be!) check out Ashley Montagu\'s ""The Natural Superiority of Women"" it\'s out of print for some unknown reason, but you\'ll be able to find a copy somewhere. This guy really says it the way it is and and backs it up with proven facts. Amazing stuff when you realize that it was written by a guy."
2393,0,"This is science?: Psychobabble. For Ms Fisher's theories to have any validity, human brains would have to be hard wired like salamanders. ALL men thinking one way and ALL women thinking another. All human beings are individuals with individual talents and abilities.The idea that women have unique talents in verbal expression flies in the face of history. How would Helen Fisher explain Shakespear, Dostoyevsky, James Joyce, or thousands of other male communicaters? And where IS this evidence of superior female abilities at communication? They don't exist. If there are differences between the male and female brains, it is a difference in style and nuance, not the determanist gulf that she postulates. Every one of her points can be easily be refuted through common experience. Helen Fisher's book is radical feminist agit-prop in the guise of scientific analysis."
2394,0,"Absolute tripe!: This is the most worthless waste of paper I have ever laid my eyes on. To say that behavior is biological is to say that human beings are software driving bodies. Women and men behave the way they do because of SOCIALIZATION and there is only minimal impact from normal physical differences (insanities are excepted, as they are aberrations)."

2396,0,"Earth to Ms. Fisher: Being open-minded, I tried to read my girlfriend\'s copy of this. When a man reads how women\'s ""superior creativity is going to change society"", you can\'t help but laugh and anticipate the upcoming comedy. Unfortunately, the writing is so condenscending, elitist, and insecure I couldn\'t even manage a grin.Ms. Fisher tell us women ""are contextual thinkers to a far greater degree than men...Women are far more talented than men."" Next, let\'s examine the Title one more time. ""The Natural Talents of Women and How They Are Changing the World"".Now let\'s look at reality. Every Fortune 500 company was started by a man. Every major invention furthering civilization in the last 200 years was thought of and created by a man. Been blind to facts and jealous with rage may be the catalyst for writing a good fictional read for fellow man-haters, but to any rational reader, this book is impossible to get past the first chapter. Now go shut up, and go make me a sammich. : )"
2397,0,"Attention all moms, this book will make you mad!: If you are a mom don't waist your time reading this book. To Ms. Fisher we are just little women with little fingers. To her your self worth is shown by what job you hold in this world and being a stay at home mom is not one with much worth. We all know that men and women have different talents. That is why men are men and women are women. Boring book."
2398,0,"Disappointing: I expected more from Helen Fisher. This book was poorly written, and is biased. I think it's fine to acknowledge the differences between men and women,in fact I'd like to see more discussion about this, especially the biological aspects. But why not show how both sexes have strengths and weaknesses, and how they compliment each other? Instead Fisher fills page after page claiming that women are superior at almost every task, and in most cases provides supporting arguments that are weak. Talents of males are mentioned as an afterthought. And of course in the 21st century the supposedly limited skill set of males will no longer be needed. I suppose many female readers will eat this up, but discrimination is discrimination, no matter where it's directed. The prose is quite choppy, kind of surprising, given the innately superior language abilities of women. She must have had a male editor."
2399,0,"Untrue.: I stand firm in my belief that both sexes contribute equally in nearly, if not, every way and aspect of human living and life. Women who think their sex race will one day conquer the Earth, or anything of that sort, speak, in my opinion, from an unfair stance. Obviously, that woman has not seen the many ways both man and woman contribute to life as we know it, and have known life throughout the history of humankind. Therefore, I suggest she take another look!"
2400,0,"Poor writing and research, very weak.: As I was reading this book I felt the author's premise was downright silly. She uses biological research to make incomplete and overly simplistic arguments to support her view that women are superior to men. I think she misjudged the reading public in taking what she - or the publishers- thought would be a popular political/social position that would sell books, especially to women. Honestly, I felt this book was so poor that I was too embarrassed to put it on my bookshelf."
2401,0,"disappointing: This movie was very disappointing though the best part of the movie was the great make-up effects on Downey, you could not even tell it was him except if you looked very closely you could see the Downey eyes and lips. The love scene was the best part of the movie."
2402,0,"NOT really about Diane Arbus: Being a photographer,knowing about Diane Arbus, and watching this movie after watching real documentaries about her, it is understood that this movie had nothing to do with Diane Arbus the person but the directors spin on a person who really exsisted but making up a story around her. The plot was somewhat slow, as was the romance between Robert Downey Jr and Nicole Kidman. Thankfully they did get her camera right. But thats about it. Over all, a waste of the money I payed for this movie."
2403,0,"My review of Fur. Read on...: Another amazing performance from Nicole Kidman in an extremely flawed film. This was an interesting concept, but the screenplay is weak, and the characters and story are both underdeveloped. There is no depth here at all. You find yourself simply apathetic towards the people on the screen, and this is never good when the film under question is supposed to be a character study.There are a few things to admire in this film, but you just can't get past the feeling that much more could have been done to make this a better film. Robert Downey Jr tries his best to deliver a strong performance, and he does a decent job here...even though he is covered with hair from head to toe through half of the film. You can barely recognize him.See only for two reasons: Nicole Kidman and Carter Burwell's score, which is amazing. I may very well purchase the soundtrack."
2404,0,"Beauy and the Beast: Diane Arbus was an artist. This was a mockery of her life and total blather. If I were one of her children, I would sue the producer, the writer and the person who is responsible for this fairy tale. It had nothing to do with the real Diane Arbus and how she lived and died. Horrible, just horrible and I would even (dare I say) like a refund. I am embarrassed to admit that I even purchased this piece of garbage. It was merely a flitting tale of Beauty and the Beast. A shambles of a story. Shame on all of you. Shame shame shame..."

2406,0,"Just Terrible: Nicole Kidman is a brilliant actress, who makes bold choices and doesn\'t play it safe. I think that\'s commendable, but the natural result is that for every brilliant movie she\'s in (The Hours, Moulin Rouge), there\'s one that\'s odd (Birth) or just bad (Bewitched).Fur is the worst of them all. Neither Kidman\'s luminous presence nor Robert Downey Jr.\'s talent are enough to save this wreck. Whoever described it as a freak show was being generous.The idea of replacing Diane Arbus\'s fascinating real life with this ""imaginary portrait"" was a bad one, the screenplay is terrible, and the direction is even worse. I hope Kidman\'s next project will be better (at least it can\'t be worse) and more suited to her enormous talent."
2407,0,"Boring and/or Unsettling: This mnovie was a complete waste of time for someone who, like me, did not have a grip on who Diane Arbus was. It is indeed ""creepy"" as one reviewer said, and got to be laughable at the end. All I wanted to do at the end of the movie was forget it, which is something I don\'t usually do. A little explanation of who she was and how she ended up would have been nice, but without that, it was a very boring and yet somehow unsettling movie! Extremely slow as well, and a waste of the talents of these two actors."

2409,0,"Where's Diane?: This film made me sad at the squandered opportunity to have shared with a new generation and a larger audience an immense American talent in visual art through the medium of photography. Rather than grapple with a complex woman in a transitional cultural time for both women and the arts, we are given this water color of a woman, dropped in the middle of a Tod Browning carnival of 'Freaks,' trivializing Arbus' groundbreaking sense of vision and boundary-challenging subject matter. What a terrific actress like Nicole Kidman could have done in bringing us the raw, authentic artist and woman had she not signed on to this 'imaginary portrait.'"

What you will find is just a plain ordinary ""Beauty and the Beast"" story that could have been about anyone. Why make this with Arbus in mind when any Jane Doe character could have done? Terrible. The only good side is that Nicole Kidman is always lovely to look at, but that\'s about it. TC"

Because we expect something in return, we want to learn; reality much more exciting than imagination if you know what to show. The claimed year--1958--looks almost perfect--main character dont have to work, husband supplies everything etc. Is it really that perfect in US in 1958 so producer concentrate on unimportant events?

We returned our first copy to the store. With the second copy, and third copy, same thing happened. All the while other games my son received work perfectly. We contacted Leapster. They sent us a new copy of the same game. Same thing all over again. I have had it. I contacted them and requested a different game. The flaw is in the programming. No other game does this in my son's leapster console. Avoid it if your are getting your child a Leapster 2."
2419,0,"Not Much To It...: My son received this game for his 5th birthday and had completed it in under a week. He loves the Cars Movie, so he still plays with it occasionally, but it is a repetitive game with little educational value. It\'s not even challenging for hand-eye coordination because you can ""win"" without much movement at all. For example, if you don\'t touch the controls your car will not go off the road, even when going around turns. It has the characters and voices that you love, but not much else. The ""Kindergarten"" cartridge lasted much longer in terms of educational and entertainment value."

Thats why I thought this would be perfect for him, i was WRONG! The game held his attention for about 15 minutes at a time and he wasnt interested at all after about 3 days of it. It wasnt the console, that works fine..it was the games. There isnt much to do on them and they get old very fast!!! Considering each game is $20-25, it would cost a fortune to buy a lot. I HIGHLY recommend getting a used console or trying out a friends before buying because I wasted a lot of money on this. It may be good for some kids but every kid is different."
2421,0,Very disappointing: I cannot see what would make anyone want to read this book. The characters are so self centered and shallow.

Gina and Sophy and Lawrence and Fergus all left me cold. I cannot imagine a group of more unlovable characters all assembled in one novel. How could anyone feel for the spoiled, self-centered, uncaring Gina? And how did she become this way? She certainly did not grow up pampered and her mother Vi seems to be a caring person. Lawrence came across as dim-witted and totally controlled by his feeling-of-the-day.

Compaq customer service has done a terrific job of skirting the issue whenever I call as to when the serial cradles will be available. I have orders in with several e-tailers for the serial cradle, and their delivery dates keep getting pushed out. What's going on? I'm seriously thinking about selling my iPAQ on eBay, I've heard it commands top dollar there. In the meantime, it makes for a sharp looking paperweight!"
2451,0,Why the shortage when the European models are shipping w/ it: why is there a shortage from Compaq for the Serial Cradles? and why are the Serial Cables coming out FIRST and charging you more ??A few people have gotten ahold of serial cables (i heard from Canada Compaq directly) what the heck ... the cables costs the same as the Serial Cradles..Plus I thought the European Ipaq are shipping with the Serial Cradles instead of USB ..
2452,0,"Unbelievable: I finally received my iPaq 3650 today, whopee! However I realised that it is almost totally useless as I run WinNT and USB is not supported! So now I have to order and wait another six-eight weeks for the serial cradle. What a load of howee!"

There was no content for a mature relationship that went beyond a few months to a year of dating.All of the advice in this book is pre marriage relationship based. It was a horrible waste of my money."
2456,0,"Written for radio, should have stayed there, a waste of brilliant speech.: This radio play was never meant to be seen, only heard. Imagination and the theater of the mind, combined with the Dylan Thomas, Welsh vocalization, made it music to my ears. Rude, lewd, and boring it never was, till filmed. Even the actors knew this and had no pride in it."

But after about 5 years, with very few times used, and not too many times needing to be charged from AC current, it would no longer charge up from an AC chord.It seems to me that if a car battery can last many years, with continuous use, this should last a lot more than 5 years.Schumacher PS-120A Mity-Mite Jump Starter Charger"
2459,0,"Battery Won\'t Last! DANGER - 90 day warranty!: I have a PS-120A I bought about a year ago. I went to use it the other day and it said RECHARGE so I Recharged it. Immediately upon plugging it in it said CHARGED. So I left it in over night, unplugged it and pushed the status button, and it said ""RECHARGE"".I called Schumacher this morning, and after waiting 20 MINUTES on hold, was told that the battery was likely bad, and that the battery had only a 90 day warranty, and that if you don\'t charge the battery once a month every month it will discharge permanently and will become landfill like mine.CAREFULLY CONSIDER whether you want to purchase a Schumacher product. I asked if there was a trade in program, or if there is anything I can do, and they said ""Buy a new battery or buy a new unit"". Hardly what I would call stellar company support, and even though they charge a premium for their products, THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND WHAT THEY MAKE!!!My next jump starter will NOT be a Schumacher."
2460,0,"Barely OK, moving toward don't buy: It worked fine for about 2 years, starting my Ford Ranger approximately 10-12 times, then just went south and wouldn't hold a charge. Same as some other reviewers here. For the money it is not a good value."
2461,0,"For the price, should last a little longer...: This thing works great... for a while. We had no problems with ours for the first year or two. At this point, it's worthless -- doesn't charge any more. If it's a planned obsolescence thing, it makes sense to buy a cheaper one and consider it disposable... Or maybe we just got a bad apple. However, given that a couple of other reviewers have noted similar problems, I suspect that our experience isn't atypical."
2462,0,"broke the first time: i wouldn't recommend this product. The positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it... I, as I was stranded, rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w/ the remaining half of the clamp. Then the charger (which was charged fully the previous night) didn't provide enough power to actually turn the engine over. I will be returning to the store tonight, returning this item, and purchasing a different charger."

I had it in my trunk and cannot find the darn little piece. As a result, I have a non-usable charger. The manufacture made such a stupid little piece and I cannot use this tool for what it intended for.As a result, I had to flag down another motorist and ""Ask for a Jump"".

2466,0,"Great Material but the Price?!: No way is this book worth the money being asked for it. People are trying to capitalize on the nostalgia players have for this excellent and out of print RPG. Yes the books are getting tough to find and Pooka happens to be a rare one. That doesn't mean a buyer should have to rationalize dishing out over $50 for this paperback that's less than what? 60 pages? I saw here on Amazon someone is asking for almost $300. I can appreciate being a collector but that kind of price tag is pure comedy. My personal recommendation is search for this book for under $30 at MOST. As an owner of this book, I can vouch that it's as fun and nifty to have as you might think, but it's not worth most of your paycheck."
2467,0,"Disappointed: When buying my product, I was under the impression that it was a new book since it was listed under the ""new"" label. When I received the book, I could already tell that book\'s condition was not according to the ""new"" description. There were very noticeable bend marks where one would place a thumb at the edge of the book to leaf through it, and there were marks at the binding where the book had been bent. Nevertheless, I am pleased to receive it in great shipping time, but disappointed in its condition."
2468,0,A garou in changeling's clothes.: I was desperately looking forward to this book... I am an avid pooka player.. but when I finally got my mits on it I nearly cried. This book just seemed like they took Werewolf and tried to put Changeling face on it... This is a grave let down and disappointment for someone who's waited years to see this book.
2469,0,"Illustrations are totally missing!: Even though on the sample page online Burgess refers to the beautiful and accurate illustrations of birds - they are completely missing in this edition! It was hugely disappointing and reveals a lack of understanding about the purpose of the book in the first place. The book was intended to be an introduction to bird identification and lore for children. It is not a simple story book - not at all! Burgess' entertaining and excellent writing, of course, remains.... I have no argument with Burgess - it is simply that half his material was left out of this publication without any notation in the description of the book that the illustrations had been deleted."
2470,0,No colored pictures in a child's book???: I was quite disappointed to see that this book has no pictures in color. How to explain to a child what the bird actually looks like!!!
2471,0,"Something's missing: The written parts are the same as the older and original, but the most importatnt part is missing--no pictures. It is very difficult to have a bird identification book without pictures. Very disappointing."

2474,0,"Wizard Alone: The one good thing I can say about this book was that it got me interested in autism for about a week. If you're going to read a book about magic, try something by Tamora Peirce."
2475,0,"Yuck.: I am not a prude, but I don't go for grown men sleeping with thirteen year old girls and rationalizing it to themselves. Between this book and Muse of Art I've developed a distaste for Anthony and his growing taste for stories about sex between prepubscent nymphos and adult men.The story itself was not very exciting. It has twists and turns, but it all falls rather flat. It wanders around, and creates a story without any grip or drive."
2476,0,"American Garbage: got this out of the bargain bin...should have left it there.It has an extremely short running time, which is a good thing, considering how boring and uncatchy the arrangements are.nothing for your money"
2477,0,"Where it all went wrong: This record was a total disappointment and turnoff for me, especially coming after great, great records like Bright Size Life, Watercolors, and the first PMG record. Some of the compositions have their moments, but mostly this is pretty boring muzak; there's hardly any improvisation, inspiration, or edginess as there was on the aforementioned albums, just a reliance on cheesy new-agey compositions. This unfortunately foreshadowed stuff that I consider to be some of the worst music Metheny ever made, like Still Life (Talking)--totally dull and sappy music. Another factor that doesn't help this album is the muffled and unimpressive production. It just has no physical presence, crispness, or clarity. After hearing the first PMG album I was totally ready for the next record to knock me out. Instead, it was a total anti-climax."
2478,0,"Disappointing: I read other reviews before purchasing this book, and had high expectations of Ms.Shannon's story. Once I began reading, however, I found her writing style to be extremely repetitive, with many sentences being paraphrased over and over again. This may be intentional, to reflect the confused state of mind during a stressful period in the author's life, but does not, in my opinion, add substance to the book or to the subject matter.Having said this, I have to mention that I do empathise with her story, being a bipolar patient myself. I just expected that a published book would have a higher quality of written English on its pages. Contrary to other reviewers' opinions, I kept having to put the book down as I tired of the writing style."
2479,0,"Don't waste your money: It's all very well somebody saying 'ignore ALL the poor reviews' but as the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire and I seriously could not recommend this CD to anybody who plays guitar. Speed guitarists have been around for years, Vinnie Vincent played in a similar way in the Eighties. All this guy is doing is playing scales as fast as possible, and if people are impressed with this kind of playing thats fine. But for me personally, it does nothing. I agree with the other reviews on the songs as well, they are poor."
2480,0,The master of slop.: This is one of the most hyped up guitar players I have listened to decades. I don't recommend this album unless you're into robotic guitar playing with absolutely no feel. The songs are a joke as well. Just an all round waste of money really.
2481,0,"Scrappy: I bought this CD after reading previous reviews, but must say that I have been very disappointed.This guitarist is nothing like any of the greats - Satrioni, Vai or Van Halen. All his music consists of is playing as fast as you can with absolutely no feel and no sense of direction. When the music does slow down it sounds like it's being made up ab-lib and is very scrappy and unoriginal. The songs on this CD also have no commercial value and are embarrassing to listen to."
2482,0,"Unoriginal and crap: Vinnie Moore, Paul Gilbert and Malmsteen were playing like this years before this guy even appeared. I have watched parts of his instruction video and it's years out of date. If you don't belive me get some Vinnie Moore from the 80's and tell me that this guy isn't ripping people like Vinnie off? The only people this will appeal to are the musicians that have no understanding of the genre. Michael Angelo looks about 50 anyway. Teenages were playing this kind of things in the 80's!!! As for the songs on this album, total and utter crap."
2483,0,Nothing new.: This album would have been good if released 20 years ago when shredding was the rage. Nowadays guitaring like this is a boring to listen to.
2484,0,"ragnarok n roll!........hey, this isn't Gwar! where's somthing good?!: cradle of filth sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! almost as much as dimmu burger. these 2 bands are only listened to by weaklings and posers. ragnarok might be kinda cool if they didn't steal their name from a gwar album, but probably not. if Gwar knew, i'm sure that this lackluster band would be ground into sports drinks to be enjoyed by all of the scumdogs, and the scraps thrown to the worm. listening to this album reminds me of what it feels like to be almost angry. its fast and agressive, but the singer sounds like he used to be a woman and became a man through the wonders of modern medicine. but enough about that, the two reviewers below me, they probably have an Eve 6 cd in their rotation between dimmel burger and ladle of filth, and they sing along with LFO. pop rockers."
2485,0,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!: I bought this combo just recently and when it came in the mail I tried it and the white light didn't work, so I returned the item to amazon and they replaced it for no charge, but to my surprise the new combo had the same problem and the white light didn't work either. I am really annoyed to see that Amazon is selling this product without any quality control. I don't recommend you to buy this combo, spare the money and patience, I will return the new bad combo and will buy another one elsewhere..."
2486,0,"unbelievable tale: Everybody seems to praise Margaret Truman for using inside information on Washington to form her books. Well I'm sorry, but I don't think Washington works the way she casts it --- certainly not as bad. Hired CIA assassins do not go after newspaper reporters, and US Senators do not take orders from the President. The ending to the book has the cavalry coming out of nowhere to rescue our heroes just in time to wrap up 300 pages of ... boredom. This book lacks the tension of a good mystery."
2487,0,"Misleading description: The photo of this article indicated 3 clubs, but only 1 was received (with a different degree than the one described -18 degree-).I've made several purchases at Amazon and the articles are usually quite close to the description, but this one isn't even close."

2490,0,"But it's not real: Though this fairly well-written book tells A story about the possibilities in the life of Vincent Van Gogh, it's not what actually happened. There are real events and words from the painter, but it's strung together in the writer's imagination. I was left feeling empty, missing a real connection to what might have motivated Vincent Van Gogh during his life. Readers are left without the means to consider Van Gogh's actual life because this is just one person's guess-though an educated one-as to what happened."
2491,0,"Flimsy sandbox: My boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox was a cool idea, being into the pirate theme. Thankfully I purchased this sandbox in-store, because I returned it the very same day. I didn't even fill it with sand before I realized it was a cheaply made toy. The plastic is thin and was bent or warped in a few places. The lid wouldn't fit on correctly, even if it wasn't bent at some of the edges it wouldn't have been a good, secure fit. I was surprised that Little Tikes would make something so flimsy. I exchanged it for the Step 2 Naturally Playful Sandbox, which is sturdier and the lid works much better. Spend the extra $10 for a sandbox that is higher quality."
2492,0,"Just fine -- until it rains!: We were quite happy with this sandbox until it rained! The lid and sides allow rainwater to fill the sandbox, and until we replaced it with a MUCH better alternative (Step 2's Naturally Playful Sandbox), we had a sandy-bottomed pool and a very disappointed little boy. Little Tikes was good about it, though, and in return for us sending them photos of the water-filled sandbox, they did send us a certificate for the purchase price to use toward other Little Tikes products."
2493,0,"Very Flimsy Lid: I bought this sandbox for my 2 1/2 year old son, and he loves playing in the sand with it. However, I am taking it back to the store & exchanging it for the Naturally Playful sandbox (which I was originally going to purchase, but got this one instead to save $10 - mistake). As soon as I put the lid on it caved in the middle (of course, I already had sand in it). Also, the lid just seems to lay on the top, and could be easily blown off. I'm sure it won't last through many sunny days or storms so it will be going back."
2494,0,"moldy sand: This sandbox is terrible. We have had it for one year now and it doesn't keep the water out even with the lid on. In fact, there are such large gaps between the lid and the box that it becomes an insect haven (spiders, earwigs etc). The wind has blown the lid off several times. And so much moisture got into it over the winter because the lid didn't fit properly that when we opened it up this spring all the sand was moldy on top. Talk about disgusting. Unfortunately, my hubby is really frugal so he won't let me buy a new box for our girls but for those of you still shopping, my advice is to save yourselves the hassle and spend an extra $10 or $15 on a better box."
2495,0,"Mediocre: I\'m working on a project about Curie, so I\'ve read several biographies about her thus far. This book isn\'t absolutely terrible, but I think it handles Curie poorly. It underexplains much about her life and motivations, gives little due to the science behind her work, and goes out of its way to make her ""inner world"" excessively dramatic. Curie\'s story is amazing and fascinating, but this book sacrifices explanatory detail and historical context in favor of an emotionally simplified (and thus more boring) version of the person. Even the title is misleading -- Curie was dedicated to her work and slightly reclusive, but she was hardly an obsessive personality.I encourage you to please check out the longer but much more engrossing biography by Susan Quinn (titledMarie Curie: A Life (Radcliffe Biography Series)), which provides the historical and scientific context necesssary to make Curie\'s story really come alive."
2496,0,"Symbol is wrong: I don\'t actually own the product, but I happened to notice something wrong. The title of the product is ""Midnight Gem LEO Zodiac Sign Dangle Belly Ring"". This is what I noticed: The symbol isn\'t Leo, it\'s Taurus! The sellers of this product needs to rename it ""Midnight Gem TAURUS Zodiac Sign Dangle Belly Ring."
2497,0,"Not happy or satisfied!!: I'm sure this item would have been nice except that my mom never got it. I bought it as part of a surprise gift for my daughter and had it shipped to my mom because they won't ship to APO. It's a shame that this company won't send stuff to the military families serving overseas, protecting their rights. Anywho, my mom never received any of the stuff and when I reported it to the company they pretty much called my mom a lier and told me that I was out of luck and wasn't going to get my money back. Thank goodness that Amazon stepped in and gave me my money back, but now I am still stuck with out any bedding for my daughters new bed. SO, I am NOT happy and satisfied with this company and I will make sure to tell all my friends not to trust this company."

2501,0,"Pure negationism: Despite its title, this book present the Nanjing massacre from the negationist point of view. Therefore, readers should be cautious. It is also appropriate to remind here that Higashinakano and his publisher were condemned in February 2009 by the Supreme Court of Japan for having defamed Shuqin Xia, an old chinese woman, by writing that she had not been a witness of the Nanking massacre and had not been filmed by John Magee.[...]"
2502,0,Why bother use Infrared: I don't know why you would need to spend the money. When I'm on the road I just sync up using the Infrared connection. Most laptops these days have the IR port and this seems to be a reason to finally use it.It's a bit slower but unless you are syncing MP3's on the road it seems to be fast enough. Fast enough even to sync e-mails with attachments.

I'm not saying that this is a bad album, simply that it is marketed as a heavy metal album, and it's not. It's a pop record. There is nothing remotely heavy about this record, unless your idea of heavy is Boston with less distortion. If very light rock is your thing, it may be something to check out, but don't be fooled by the title or the cover. Trust me, this wasn't even heavy by 70's standards."

This seems great until you try to play it for awhile and it keeps telling you that you are low on items. Even after you add everything it still dumps you out so you have to start again.

2515,0,"Stay away from this car seat: We got this car seat as a gift. From the beginning we had problems with it. The seat didn't seem to fit into the base very well, and it was always a struggle to connect and disconnect the seat from the base. The second time we used the seat, we noticed the foam pads inside the head support had disintegrated into dust, and had gotten all over our baby's head and clothes. There is a reason why this car seat it so cheap, and its because its a poor quality product. Luckily, we purchased a Graco car seat and have had no problems with it."
2516,0,"I am disappointed: I purchased this stuff about half year ago when there is a promotion at Amazon. My daughter was born in Oct and we started to use this. On the second day, we found the sponge in the car seat had been degraded and were completely in the form of powder. Even worse, the sewing was so terrible that the disgusting powder continuously dropping everywhere. We had to make more stitches to keep that stuff inside. I will never buy any product with this brand in the future! never forever!"
2517,0,"Really awful: I thought I could deal with the things other reviewers said about this seat, but really, it was a waste of money. The lining is disintegrating and the base stuck to the seat for weeks and I couldn't separate the two. Go with something else!"

I finally contacted Combi and they sent a replacement free of charge (not even shipping). Now, a month later, it is turning to dust. Also, when the new cover was sent the newborn insert and the padding for the belt was not included. I don't think you can buy this product anymore, but if you can DON'T!!!"
2519,0,"Ewww.......: I also had the problem with the disintegrating cover (after 2 months of use), but got a free replacement from Combi, and it arrived within two days after calling to complain. Much better customer service than I would have guessed based on other reviews.My son was comfortable in this seat, it was nicely padded and had ample space. My one complaint was with loosening the strap. I actually had to dig around under the car seat cover and press down really hard to loosen the straps, despite the red stitching in the cover where it says to press. The cover is way too thick to pull that off.UPDATE: Replacement cover began to disintegrate within 2 days of arrival. Calls to combi customer service go unreturned. I replaced this with a Graco Snugride, and this seat went out with the trash. It's a messy, disgusting hassle that combi can't be bothered to fix correctly. Between the nasty seat cover and the flaky customer service, I wouldn't buy a Combi product again."

You can take the padding out and shake all the dust off and the next day that you use it, its all there again.I was also missing the canopy in my box and they offered to send me one for ""free"" but the shipping was $17. I paid them for the shipping because the canopy is a necessity for me but felt really disappointed in the company for it (by the way, the postage stamped on the envelope that the canopy came in was about $3).If it weren\'t for the poor customer service and the disintegrating foam, the carseat would be a 3 star anyway. Its often hard to remove from the base and you have to work it free. The carrying handle is also often hard to put down because the side button releases get stuck. I really regret my choice in buying Combi, I won\'t make that mistake again."
2521,0,dust everywhere: Don't buy this from amazon.com. Sponge inside of the carseat cover became a dust when I first open the box and the dust was spreaded everywhere. Nobody wouldn't want to use this dirty stuff for newborns. Don't be fooled by its price.
2522,0,"would not recommend: I did massive research for a carseat and would not recommend this one. Bulky, long car seat base which does not fit well in Honda civic. Flimsy canopy, heavy seat, padding that dissolved when washed by hand. Very disappointed."
2523,0,"Very Light, Difficult to Buckle, Falling Apart: It is hard to buckle, you really have to push hard and make sure not to pinch baby at the same time. Canopy is very flimsy and droops, not to mention, short and doesn't cover well. Velcro from diapers, pacifier holder, etc pulls the fabric giving it a pilled look. The foam underneath is crumbling and making messes everywhere. I bought it before she was born so it is too late to return it now that I know all this! However, it is very light and easy to carry."
2524,0,Difficult to work with: Typing is very difficult on this keyboard. You often have to stop and rehit a letter many times to get it to be recognized. Touch typing is out of the question.
2525,0,"not good: Has a lot of loose connection issues - so it doesn't work some times. If you move the keyboard a bit, when it is working, it stops working. It collects dust. I don't know how waterproof it is - dont want to try it - already ordered another normal keyboard. Yes, I have key press issue to...I have to strike it hard with concentration in order for the keys to work."
2526,0,"pretty bad...: There are several problems with this keyboard. 1 is that it has no number pad. another is that the lights don't light up when you click Caps lock or num lock or somthing, so you never know if its on or off until you type something.The biggest is that the buttons just plain suck. You have to really push down hard to get the letter to register, it destroys your typing speed, and butchers anything you try and type.the only redeming quality is that you can spill things on it and then just clean it off."
2527,0,"You get what you pay for: Howdy,I bought these towels last week during the Friday Sale, understanding that I would be getting 6 separates for 8 bucks. I was not expecting high quality, and totally got what I paid for. Out of the packaging the towels had strings which were already running; the hems were not complete and separating from the towel itself. I then washed them, I understand that towels will pill... but please! Pill city! I have fuzzies in my hair that I am fishing out.If they last a year, it will be worth the 8 bucks, then they may make excellent rags. Just don't use them on your car! Unless you like the fuzzy look."

2530,0,"It's not good deal.: I purshased this towel set for Yoga exercise, because 6-pieces and very cheap price. However as the price said, the quality of towel was terrible. They have shrunk in the wash at once and cotton lint came out much. It's cheap, but I don't think it's worth to buy."
2531,0,"Pem America Towels: These towels are horrible. They almost seem as if they are irregular towels. One towel did not match the seams of the others, one was unraveled, they leave lint everywhere and they do not absorb water very well. I will not buy more of these."
2532,0,A $49.95 value?: I was not thrilled with the advertising on this one that claimed it was a luxury towel set with a $49.95 value. The set came in a plastic bag and the quality of the towels were very low average. I was not impressed and wish I had not bought so many.
2533,0,Towel Set: When these towels arrived they had a strange unpleasant oily smell to them. I put them into the washing machine and they practically fell apart. I had to scrape pieces of the towels from the machine tub. It was packed with heavy sticky lint and I am just lucky that my machine survived the ride. I use them now to dry the dogs. They were cheap so I guess you get what you pay for! I do not recommend these towels as they are a total waste of money.
2534,0,These Towels Are Terrible: They are some of the worst towels I have ever purchased. They are not very absorbant. They wash horribly. I'll never purchase another set again. Amazon should be giving them away!!!
2535,0,Falling apart after one washing!: Not very good quality. Kind of scratchy. Staring falling apart after first wash!

I can't rave about it..but at the same time I don't hate it. The frech blue color is very pretty...but the quality of the towels are that great for me to love!

An insult to the reader.For a good read on Martha Gellhorn, try Caroline Moorehead's Gellhorn: A Twentieth Century Life - a much more in-depth look at the subject and a superior quality of writing. Ms Moorehead is clearly a writer who knows her stuff. (Check out her latest, Human Cargo, for a powerful work on refugees)."

The attachment didn't really fit on the hairdryer and fell off when I used it. I am not even sure why the description says diffuser/volumizer because on the box it just says diffuser. I returned it as soon as i got it."
2540,0,"Horrible--quit working...: This product stopped working completely within 4 months of owning it. I don't even dry my hair every day. I use a hair dryer an average of 3-4 days a week and dry my hair for about 5 minutes. The heat settings didn't seem to work--the temperature setting was not consistent at all. And, most importantly, this completely stopped working after less than 4 months. I would definitely go with something else!"
2541,0,"warning- Very Short Cord: The andis company is very good for hairdryers, yes they tend to have a heavy motor, but thats because they last a long time.This hairdryer was cheap for a reason, I found out after i bought it, the cord is VERY SHORT.

2542,0,"A Travesty: One of the finest Sherlock Holmes short stories, ""Charles Augustus Milverton"" showcases Holmes and Watson at their very best: brave, dashing, and humorous. This Granada adaptation manages to throw out every feature that makes the story great, padding it out with unconvincing background detail and, in one particularly dreadful episode, suggesting that Holmes has actually fallen in love. Designed to give Jeremy Brett an actor\'s holiday, this little scene is an index to everything that went wrong with this series in its later years -- sentimental, unnecessary, and ludicrously untrue to Conan Doyle."
2543,0,"STAY AWAY: I would not even give this phone to my 4 year old. My daughter was recently hospitalized out of town, and for convenience sake I had to use my cell phone instead of long distance. I moved around, went outside (under a clear sky) and had absolutly horrible reception. The entire time you are on the phone with someone, you expect them to disappear, because his phone is terrible. Pick something else."
2544,0,"horrible horrible phone: it gets horrible reception except in the most covered area. i live less than a mile from a major shopping center with a tower and i get no reception standing in my front yard. i have to call three or four times before my call goes through because i get ""network busy"" or ""call ended"" signals incessantly. ive had it for less than 6 months and the screen is very loose at the hinge. the buttons lose their spring action quickly and several of the buttons backlighting have already begun to fade.poor signalpoor designpoor qualityminimum of featuresand it cost me $180 without signing up for another two years on my contract."
2545,0,"no signal: Both me adn my mom bought this phone about 6 months ago. She's had her's replaced once already because the screen woulnd't come on. Neither of the phones ever get good reception, with an average of 2 bars, which quickly disapear if the phone is lifted to the ear."
2546,0,"Don't. Buy. This. Phone.: Where to begin?I've had the charging problems that others have mentioned. Also, the phone sometimes just turns itself off. Very convenient when you're expecting an important call. The external LED isn't even mentioned in the user's manual. It's there purely for decoration, apparently. The software on the phone is of a generally clunky quality. I can get to the Ringtones shop in one click, but if I miss a call, it's 3 or 4 clicks to check for the caller's identity. You can see where Cingular's priorities are...The one mitigating factor I'll mention is that the reception has improved greatly since I installed the new antenna that I was sent by Cingular.Next time, I'm buying a Nokia or a Samsung."
2547,0,"most diverse review on the planet: I have the LG C1300.. the design is good but it is too small, and that idle light i hate.. the ringtone quality is real tones & mulitimedia is ok and text is the very best.. it can handle text better than anyother phone that i have had. the battery when i talk on my phone in an average weekend it lasts me the whole weekend and i stay on the phone for a total of 42 hours in the eqlivent of text and net and that sort.. and the call quality is not really that all awesome some days i can call out and sometimes i cant cause the phone is weird and in a 5 bar place i cant call out sometimes and it has been doing that too me since i got the phone.. and my quote ""ALL-in-ALL"" opinon is be careful when you choose that phone there a more downs than there is ups with that phone. so i would like to say that i warn you not to get that phone.."
2548,0,Just got it: I just got this phone last week from Cingular. I got it for $29.99 which I thought was a good price. I don't care much for Cingular. I am an old AT&T customer. I don't always get my messages on it. I have tried to register it with AOL mobile and I still have not gotten my confrim message yet. I don't like the side buttons I am always hitting them. Otherwise I like it so far.
2549,0,"Beware of this phone ...bad antenna on most: Keys not designed for adult human use... volume buttons on side where a person usually holds the phone will set off rings/noises usually at an awkward time.LG also knows there is a problem with the antenna on most of these phones. They started replacing the stock antenna with a better(""red"") antenna, but they didn\'t get to a lot of them, especially the ""free"" ones they give you at Cingular.You have to call ""Warranty Service"" to get the new ""red"" antenna to get service without mega cutoffs. --If you live in an apartment; DON\'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PHONE! -- And good luck on a speedy finding of where the earphone/mike handless plug is.."
2550,0,"Realy, realy bad phone: Do not get this phone. I got it for free and it was cool at first but after a few days I got *dissapointed*. Sometimes when I dialed a number and hit the talk button, I put the phone to my ear and waited. Then I looked at the screen and the *useless* thing had gone to the main menu. Also the volume is *really* bad. You have to push the speaker into your ear really hard to hear somone on the other end.WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"
2551,0,"Too many BUGS!: I only owned the phone for about two weeks and it was already acting up. First, the hinges became kind of squeaky and just felt horrible to hold the phone. Then, the battery wouldn't even charge. I plugged it into the charger and it looked like it was charging but when I pulled it out, it was still at one bar. And it went down to one bar overnight.. after I had charged it until it was supposedly full. It appears that other people had this problem as I saw people returning the same phone because of these issues.So I highly don't recommend it."
2552,0,"I hate this phone!: I have owned this phone about a month and I\'ve had to take it back to the store 2 times already. The first time the phone ""pretended"" like it was charging but remained only @ 1 bar after charging for 12+ hrs. The second time the phone would drop my calls after about 3sec. of talking. The phone is very small and cute and the ringtones sound really good, but that\'s about the only thing redeemable about the phone."
2553,0,"BEWARE: I have had this phone for about 5 months now and its had problems since the beginning within one day of having it the hindges started to sqeak on and off. About a month ago i could make absoutly no calls because their was a signal problem. and just a couple of days ago my volume got screwed up and now it can't go past level 3, which is VERY hard to hear. Another thing about this phone is the ringer it cannot be turned off ascending so you cant hear the ringtone untill about 20sec later. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE"
2554,0,"THE WORST EVER: This phone is consistent with the quality of phones I've received from Cingular. It's A PIECE OF CRAP! I too, get no reception in my own house, and it holds a call like greased hands hold a greased ball of grease that was soaked with grease with a grease soaker. It is the worst of the worst. The speaker is crap, of you shift it at all from your EAR HOLE... sorry for the technical lingo... but if you do that, you won't hear anything. It won't charge unless the phone is turned off, and the battery lasts for about two hours of talk time, and about a day of powered on time. The most irritating part is the battery, but the dropped calls is a close second. I swear you can have five bars, but as soon as you push the call button, it will drop to two... DO NOT CHEAP OUT AND GET THIS PHONE! UPGRADE!"
2555,0,"Crappy, crappy, phone: The external light doesn't serve any purpose, exept maybe to dupe people into thinking that this phone has external caller ID or an external clock. The antenna sucks too. Get a Motorola or a Samsung."
2556,0,Worst Phone I've Ever Owned: I recieved this phone as a bonus from Cingular to upgrade to a family plan. This is by far the worst reception on a cell phone that I've had in the 10 or so years I've been using cell phones. I can't use it at all inside my house. Even when I'm driving and I'm getting a strong signal sometimes I can't make out what the other person is saying. I feel like crushing this phone sometimes. I have had people call me 3 or 4 times and I never know about it and than they will get through to me and say that they've been trying to call me and while we are talking it will notify me that I've missed 3 calls. Unbelievable!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!
2557,0,"Not worth it....: -I\'ve had this phone for about one year. I\'ve hated it since week one.-It\'s a bit too small (which I suppose some might like)-I get dropped calls all the time (Cingular)(I never had a problem with that on my OLD Nokia)-the volume can never be turned up enough-the ear piece is worthless-the buttons on the side are a pain because they get pushed and it changes it to silent mode etc.There was a recall on the orginal antenna. I had mine replace with the ""upgrade"" and noticed no difference with reception.Even though I got this phone for free from Cingular I feel like I was ripped off. I spoke with an employee at a Cingular store and he agreed with me that it is a horrible phone. It makes me wonder why Cingular would put thier name on a horrible phone.....oh yeah, they don\'t care about thier customers."
2558,0,"DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!: This phone is horrible. I live in the middle of a big city and i dont get reception in my own house. People sound gargled and like their in a tunnel. The mirror on the front get scratched way to easily. I think the only thing cingular was thinking of when the made this phone was the size. it is the worst phone i have ever owned. DONT BUY IT. Its a waste of money. Find a better phone that might be bigger, but at least u will be able to talk on it. :( I wish i could give it lower than a 1 as a rating. I would give it a -5."
2559,0,"DON'T BUY IT!!!: This is the worst phone I have ever had. The speaker is terrible. You have to shove it into your ear to hear anything, even after you have turned the volume all the way up. After having it for 3 MONTHS, the screen went blank and I couldn't see anything. Luckily, Cingular sent me a new one. However, the battery would only last for about two days with the new one, and I had to buy a new battery. The buttons on the side are a pain because they will get pushed inside your pocket and make the phone beep and go out of silent mode. Very annoying. So, like I said, DON'T BUY IT!!!"
2560,0,"Very Disappointing: My fiance and I both purchased one of these phones about a year ago. My screen went completely black about two-three months ago and now his is slowly fading. The phone still works fine, but forget about reviewing missed calls, viewing your phone book, changing your ringtone....it is pretty much a useless phone. I thought my phone was an accident, but now that his is non-functioning I know it is LG's fault. Don't waste your money, you will need to replace it."
2561,0,"God-awful phone: I don't need my cell phone to take pictures, play music, access the internet, or do my taxes for me. I just want it to work. I just want to be able to hear the person I'm talking to and function as a phone. That's it. This phone fails even that basic test. Stay away from it. It will turn your hair gray."
2562,0,"Cingular is the problem: This phone is not worth the money they charge for it. The voice message never worked right. The volume buttons were on the side of the phone so I was always turning it down to where I couldn't here it on accident. But the worst part is having a contract with cingular. I had a problem with the voicemail so I called their service number and waited 30 min just to speak to someone and they didn't even fix the problem. And they were charging me minutes to talk to them. My husband is military and we moved to Germany, so we canceled the service before our contract was up. Now Cingular wants the phones, manuals, chargers and box back or they will charge us $250 each phone which is outragous. I of course don't have the box or manual. This phone and cingular are not worth the trouble and expense."
2563,0,"There should be laws against this phone.: It's cute and light-weight. However, I've only had about 3 phone conversations that were not very choppy or down-right incoherent and dropped. We bought 3 of these for our family and they are almost always unusable. There is an echo in one of them. We have had 4 other phones, mostly Nokias, and they all served us very well. These are going back. Hope you don't wind up with one. In shopping for a replacement, ALL the sales people say that they are getting a lot of these phones back. They have a horrible reputation. I'm glad to read that some people are not having problems with theirs, though."

2565,0,"Candy thermometer only good for certain types of candy: I bought this candy thermometer because I was interested in getting into candy making. In particular, I wanted to give tempering chocolate a try and thought that with such high ratings, this would be perfect for doing it right.I was very disappointed to find that the temperature gauge on this candy thermometer doesn't go low enough for tempering chocolate. This doesn't make a lot of sense to me, since chocolate seems like a pretty common candy thing to do, but the temperature gauge only goes down to 100 degrees, while tempering chocolate requires measuring down to ~84 degrees.While I'm not going to throw it away (it's still fine for deep frying), I'm going to need to find something else for doing chocolate."

I would recommend buying a different camera if you use Windows 2000. I will have to buy another camera now that I use mostly Windows 2000.
2569,0,"Off to a bad start...: I hear of Intel quite a bit nowadays. I expected their products to perform reasonably well... This flimsy hunk of plastic refused to comply with everything I tried to have it do. It would take one snapshot, then freeze. Then, once I got the program to become unstuck, my computer would crash, rendering everything on my computer dead. Then, after a few rounds of this, I decide to remove the software. Bad idea. It took over a half-hour of battle with this monstrosity to pry its deathgrip off my system. The closest I could get to determining the cause of this debacle is that, on the back of the box, it says that it's optimized for Pentiums. I have an AMD Athlon. ? Any help would've worked, but the forum for video and conferencing on intel.com was deactivated in April. Probably because people got fed up w/ a $140.00 P.O.S. and quit dealing with it.

The writer clearly believes herself better than her audience and sets about proving it on almost every condenscending page after page. Her examples are nothing new and could easily be found with a simple Google search. Her logic is also poorly founded and easily refuted at almost every turn. The only greed and corruption I see is Ms Huffington trying to get people to give her money for this piece of junk. What a waste. Don\'t bother with it."
2573,0,Her book is as unclear as her speech: The author presents ideas that are outdated and imposible to implement into society. She is obviously an idealogue who is incapable of relating reality to government. She provides simple solutions to difficult problems. It just doesn't connect and her kame logic permeates this book. I would give a lower rating one star but there is no choice.

WARNING: I noticed there are several other versions of this book (all entitled ""The Novels of Jane Austen (Large Print Edition)"" with no description given; publisher is BiblioLife)for sale. I\'m not sure whether this is some kind of scam or a sneaky way for some dude to get his WiMAX info published?"

This book is dry and unimaginative. The author's view of the year 2000 is almost comical. In over a hundred years(the book was written in something like 1887) the only change is that all of humanity has learned to work together. The funny thing is that is all this time the mode of dress has stayed the same. So somehow man has changed his entire inherently selfish nature but hasn't been able to come up with a better shoe style in a hundred years. Give me a break. If you are looking for a thought provoking look at the future I suggest Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. As for Bellamy's Looking Backwards, leave it on the shelf."

Most students and faculty agreed that the book raised excellent questions for discussion, but the dry, flat style of the writing made it very difficult to read. After falling asleep several times trying to read this at night, I finally forced myself to read it early in the morning. Bellamy spends much of the novel explaining how this socialist utopia functions, providing detailed analysis of the economy, government, education, and other institutions. I would recommend this book to readers interested in discussing political issues, but not for readers who need a strong plot or dynamic characters."
2583,0,"book was in new condition...: This book is bad. The socialist Utopia taken to new heights, socialist USA. I knew this was a book highlighting the greatness of communal society, it was worse than most because it tries to paint the America of the past with a Marxist brush. It attempts to place liberty into a socialist utopia where, even in this complete work of fiction, it can't live. There is nothing particularly interesting or new here. Stick to the classics if u are amused by the socialist ideology."

2587,0,"This book really isn\'t worth the money.: I am not a big fan of this book. If you subscribe to ""The Autograph Collector"" magazine, you would know that 80% of the magazine is advertisements, and you would think spending [money] on a book you wouldn\'t have 25 pages of ads. Also, many of the signatures in this book do not match signatures I have received in person. In stead of the ad\'s they should have used that extra 25 pages to list more examples of stars signatures, or at least list more people. I would suggest that they make the signatures themselves smaller, as many people are copying the signatures out of the book onto index cards and photos, and selling the forgeries on ebay. All together, I would suggest you buy a different book; this one is not even worth what you would pay for it used."

Also, I note that there are few games available that support XP directly."
2590,0,"Devil Bat: this dvd movie get grainy ,is not totally restored,i know is an oldest movie but get a lot grainy not like thy others oldest movies."
2591,0,"Nothing Special Here: Killer Bats is a movie that will generate a few chuckles, not just with the acting, but also for the inferior special effects and set. It's easy to follow this film and its plot of a mad scientist turning loose killer bats on people, and the humorous idea of using a special aftershave scent to attract the bats. The picture quality in some ways is what you would expect from a film that's over 70 years old, but in other ways it should've been preserved better. The best part about this movie is its length: just 69 minutes of madness!!! If you like the chiller thriller genre, and are a fan of Bela Lugosi, then give this one a try. You may like it more than I did. This film seems to be hit or miss. It was a miss for me."
2592,0,Be wary: The morons I purchased this item from sent me just another copy of Devil Bat. Just Black & White with no color version. A real pisser.
2593,0,"So-so: Yet another of Lugosi's bargain-basement epics, this one suffers from poor scripting and a general lack of ideas. The formula repeats itself as the annoying reporter confronts the mad scientist. There are a few fun moments, but the horribly stale formula plot really doesn't hold up very well. It's OK for the viewer with a little time to kill, but it's no classic."

2595,0,"Cropped picture, few extras. Buy the original GOLD EDITION: To put it plainly, this movie was filmed in FULL FRAME 1:33-1, not widescreen as presented here. For some reason the folks at Disney decided to create a fake widescreen version by cropping off 25% of the picture from the top & bottom! What is ""Most Wanted"" about this edition is the people in charge that decided crop the picture and give you less!This is equal to watching Star Wars in a square picture, YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE FULL PICTURE.And the extras.... can you call them true special edition extras? The only reason to get this is for the deleted scene, which you will be glad was deleted after you see the sketches!BUY THE ORIGINAL GOLD CLASSIC EDITION, it is worth its gold for the full picture!"

I am not going to ask these people to sent the DVD'S back to me and then ship them back for a refund. It is embarrassing and disappointing. Does Disney do this kind of thing? I guess I will find out.

When I received the package the cover of the DVD was the movie I ordered but when I put the film in the screen was blank with the words ""check regional code"" and there was no option to hit play or enjoy this film with my family. So, as you can imagine I was p.o. I emailed Movie Mars Inc. to inquire about a refund, we have been emailing back and forth about this matter and I had to ship the item back to them on my dollar and I\'m still waiting for my refund...it\'s been one month!I have never had an issue using Amazon vendors before so please don\'t be to discouraged by this review, I personally would never use Movie Mars Inc again."

2600,0,Robin Hood: I am not sure that the one I received was the one that I say pictures of. The one that I thought I ordered came with the raised slip cover. I also did not know what the region 2 meant and it does not play in any DVD player in our house.
2601,0,"25% Less Movie than the Original!: The original theatrical version of this film was NOT widescreen. For this DVD, Disney took a non-widescreen movie and MADE it widescreen. What does this mean for you? Less movie! Since they cannot ""add"" footage to fill in the sides of a widescreen TV, the only way they can do it is to zoom into the picture and crop out the top and bottom! This destroys any sense of composition those poor layout artists worked so hard to achieve, and is essentially like watching the film with your eyes half closed. In order to fill your widescreen television, and tout this release as ""Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions,"" Disney thought it was a good idea to bring you 25% LESS movie. If viewed on a standard TV, you now see black bars at the top and bottom of our screen, where there were none before!Get the ""Disney Gold Classic Collection"" version if you want to see the film in its entirety."
2602,0,"The Story of Robin Hood is much better!: I liked this as a child, but it\'s really one of Disney\'s weaker animated films and lacks a lot of the attention to detail that sets apart the studio\'s real Classics. Some of the scenes look like actual tracings from other movies (the scene where Maid Marian is dancing with the animals - it\'s Snow White and the Dwarfs down to every move!). I recently rented Disney\'s live action ""The Story of Robin Hood"" and was so impressed I went out and bought the video - great film full of excitement and suspence. It also explained the whole legend of Robin Hood better and gave the characters a bit more depth. This animated version is only so-so."
2603,0,"Wrong product: I made a mistake in not verifying the media before I bought this product. I received a VHS tape, when I thought I had ordered a DVD."
2604,0,"This gets a special edition?!: I know I will not be the only who sees Robin Hood as one of the most artistically poor of all of Disney's animated features, unfortunately, people think of this kind of animation when they think of '70s Disney and forget that the Disney seventies were so much superior to this.Robin Hood is weak in story-line, characters and specially artistry and yet, it seems to have a rating of 7.3 at IMDb and a high rating here, too, I guess that's the reason for the special edition because there are many other more deserving Disney films out there (The Sword in the Stone, or The Rescuers to name a few, you know the *real* Disney masterpiece films?) and Robin Hood isn't even close. Sure, it's entertaining, but the DVD release it got once was enough to satisfy it, I personally can't see the film improving with a digital restoration.Still, before saying anything else, I'll wait until the Special Edition is out and then we'll see, but so far, this film gets a 2/5."
2605,0,"DON'T purchase from godsnet!: I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my grandson. I FULLY admit my mistake; I thought it was a DVD version not a VHS. Immediately after I hit the purchase button, I caught my error. At that moment, (not more than 1 minute after purchase) I sent an email explaining that I was sorry but I didn't want the item. I sent a total of THREE requests to please cancel the order. I didn't receive a single response from them. My VHS version of Robin Hood came in the mail and the money was deducted from my account. The VHS tape is still sitting on my dresser in the original mailing box, in the wrapper and of no use to me. I will NEVER purchase again from godsnet and would STRONGLY recommend others not to. I made a mistake yes, and would not be leaving a negative response if they would have just contacted me. No response at all makes me question the ethics of this company. RED FLAGS are up for a reason."

2607,0,"Would Not Play: Tried playing the DVD on two different DVD players without success. I had a VHS copy of this movie years ago and loved the movie. This was a gift for my little nephew. Needless to say, we were very disappointed that this DVD would not play. I contacted the seller, who suggested it may have been a European version, and then left it up to me to figure that out based on looking for either the number ""1"" or ""2"" somewhere on the item description page. I would suggest that sellers make this information more apparent on the item description page when selling to both customers in the U.S. and Europe. It is important to note, as with many Disney movies, this DVD is not in current production and availability is limited. As a result, this item was purchased from an independent seller through Amazon.com. I love Amazon.com and do not feel that Amazon was in any way at fault for the lack of disclosure in the product description for this item."

2609,0,"Very Disappointed: I ordered this dvd on December 1st. I had no idea it was coming from ITALY. It was to be a Christmas present, but I received it January 15th. The cover and all writing is in Italian! The worst thing is that it will not play on the dvd player, or the x-box. It will play in the laptop. It says this dvd is only available for viewing in Italy and a bunch of other foreign countries nowhere near here. I ordered it from Utah, you would think they could send it here and it would play. I have never heard of such a thing. I can't send it back because it had to go back to Italy and I will not deal with that overseas mailing hassle. This has been a nightmare and I feel Amazon shouldn't work with 3rd parties like these people. I like to order from Amazon. You can see that I have a long history and have ordered many things from Amazon. First disappointment. Please check into these vendors and do not associate with them."
2610,0,"inexpensive but not very good: Tone-wise, Chromes can't hold a candle to Thomastik-Infeld Jazz Swing strings. I suppose that is somewhat forgivable since Chromes cost less than half what Thomstik-Infeld Jazz Swing string cost. However, what puts me completely off them, to the point that I'd rather use GHS Precision flatwounds if I couldn't find Thomastik-Infelds, is that they are very slippery under my fingers. I don't get the same kind of tactile connection with the strings that I get with every other brand of flatwounds I've every used."

I used it twice beacause i thought maybe i just didnt apply it right but it didnt matter it just didnt look natural. I probably wont use it again but its just my skin that didnt work with it maybe it does for other people but not me. ill probabaly go back to the Mary Kay concealer which works muchbetter on me and actually blends in with myskin tone."

I put them on my wife\'s 2004 Toyota Camry and my 2004 Toyota Echo, and they seem to have apparently ""dried out"" while exposed to sunlight, for every time you turn on the wipers, they ""skid"" along the windshield and make a lot of noise. My wife complained to me about them... more than once... saying they were EXTREMELY noisy. They worked OK for a VERY short time, but it didn\'t take them very long to become ""dried out"" and start ""skipping along"" on the windshield, making much noise, and no longer cleaning the windshield as they were meant to do. Apparently, Anco uses VERY low quality rubber for these... hence the low price. If I could have given them zero stars, I would have. I am 64 years of age and have had many different windshield wiper blade replacements in my life, but never with such poor results. Don\'t waste your money on these!!!!"

There's nothing to say other than, the Amazon app that, helps you find the right parts for your vehicle, specified a wiper blade that not only didn't fit, it wasn't even the correct mount. What a waste of time and money!"
2620,0,"Not-so-secret society.: Let me ask you - if you ran a ""secret"" society, would you have your groups emblem cast in iron and set on a rooftop? No? Then, would you also consider this a ""secret"" society if evryone and their mother knew of it\'s existence? I didn\'t think so. Such is the first of many major flaws in this campy movie. The plot is interesting and if you can get past all of the fluff in this one - then you\'ll enjoy this movie.For myself, I found myself laughing at this one more than anything else. ""A skull above any other!"" What the heck does that mean?"
2621,0,"Too fantastical: Interesting premise but carried to such fantastical extreme as to disabuse. The story deteriorates from a somewhat intriguing tale to imaginary nonsense. Director Cohen does say in his commentary that since nobody really knows what goes on in those ""secret"" societies at Yale, Harvard, etc. (and as a Harvard alum I have to add, nobody cares), Cohen and his colleagues could let their imaginations run free. Well, they did. Yale, meet the Addams Family and The Munsters. Morticia and Lurch are more believable than the Skullsters in this thing. Nicely photographed movie though, especially the ersatz Ivy League interiors, somewhat reminiscent of older edifices at the real Harvard. Kudos for cinematography. Thumbs down on plot. Thumbs up for Craig T. Nelson as Mandrake, Sr., a cad you come to relish hating."
2622,0,"Had potential but...: Horrible movie. This movie looked interesting in the previews, then I saw it. Boy I learned my lesson fast. It was full of scenes with unintentionally funny dialoge and Characters that are stupid and just for the sake of moving the script and story along. Only reason to see it is to look at Paul Walker. Skip and go rent Lords of Discipline or School Days? This is a waste of money. Runnnnn!"
2623,0,"Not too good: The idea was probably good - try to make a movie allegedly based on the real-life secret society Skull & Bones (of which many politicians, including George W. Bush and his father, and numerous influential business people are members). Somewhere along the way, however, the train came off the tracks. This film makes the society and its actions hokey. If the filmmaker truly wanted the almost unbelieveable real story to come out, he should have made a documentary."
2624,0,"Agh! Another dire Hollywood movie!: This is a very bad film... It is nicely shot, and the set location is good, but the plot (college kid outsmarts global super-powerful secret society) is just terrible. It's one of those films where you actually hope there isn't a happy ending (we can wish, can't we?!)"
2625,0,"Poorly plotted and pictured and definentely not worth it.: The movie has a good story, but they messed it up with their begginig and silly end. It's definetely NOT worth it."
2626,0,"You must see this film: This is a simply awesome film. Suspense, action, thrills, this film has everything. Suitable for all age groups but if your 15 to 20 you will love this."
2627,0,"Garbage: I work at a video store, and I had heard this movie was bad, so for fun I decided to watch this movie before it came out. It was laughably horrible. I figured people would hate this film when it came out, but I have not heard ONE negative remark! People always complain about movies that are different and refreshing (like Titus and Magnolia), but no one seems to care that this movie is one of the worst of the year. Obviously, people don't have good judgment about films, so hopefully you do and don't buy this garbage."
2628,0,Not worth watching even for free!!!: Find something better to do than which this dribble. Nothing makes any sense and the ending is incredibly stupid. Lousy acting and silly screenplay only add to the mess of this movie.
2629,0,"Based on a true secret society organization: at Yale University known for producing multiple U.S. Presidents, CEOs, Tycoons, etc. However, this story doesn't document the group but rather loosely uses it as a storyline backdrop only. It probably will leave most people dissatisfied although it is fairly well played and can be tense at times."
2630,0,"\'Skulls\' hits a nail, dead in the head.: I have gone to a museum and seen more life in a skull, than in the film The Skulls, a cheesy teen thriller about a college student who reluctanley gets into a secret society, named for the title, The Skulls and then procedes to find flaws in it, only then wanting to get out, and discovering the only way out, is to die. The only thing thats worth watching in this bore fest is Lesley Bibb, who we dont even get to see as much as we\'d like. There is no suspence in this suspence, and no depth with the charactors, other than that they would pretty much do anything to get into a ""secret society."" The directings not all that bad, but it doesnt help, the actings not either, like i said with the exception of Bibb, and the writings not even all that swell. The Skulls did resemble a teenage version of The Firm, which was a way better film all together, but what can you expect from the whole set of the WB. Just kidding."
2631,0,"Horrible [movie] - Staying Awake Has Never Been Harder: Wow, I thought that the whole secret soceities idea might make a cool movie, but I was quite wrong. I mean, come on, horrible script, worse acting, and how long is this movie anyway? It seemed many hours passed under the torture of one retarded scene after another. The only plus, if you can call it that, is that you can laugh at the moronic dialogue and situations that arise. Even funnier ... is that this movie actually takes itself seriously."
2632,0,"Suitable for cable: A forgettable product, a weak effort by director Rob Cohen. Joshua Jackson is disappointing as the lading character in this movie about a ""secret"" society where everybody knows who is a member or not !!! The accepted members erceive twenty thousand dollars on the spot and spend it withno low-profile at all !! A bad movie, no doubt, but you can watch it if you\'re totally out of options."
2633,0,"Pure CHEESE.: This movie is so stupid I'm not sure where to begin. Right from the start, you are subjected to poor acting, EXTREMELY pathetic dialogue, and an overall lame story. I almost enjoyed watching this for its laughable cheesiness. I give it one star because I was amused by the dialogue that was either inconceivably stupid or stereotypical, as well as the obvious homoerotic undertones between the 2 main characters. Several scenes were there for no other reason than to suggest there was more going on between these guys than was shown, if ya know what I mean."
2634,0,"This movie was so bad!: I am doing this review only because thus far it has a five star rating and I can not let that stand because it may lead some poor lost soles to buy this movie. Cheesy, badly acted, and very unbelievable. 1 star just because I think you have to give it at least that according to the Amazon review rules."
2635,0,"A JOKE ..: This movie is a joke. IT\'s not a movie to make you feel anger, but definitely is a bad production. The plot is so full of holes I could not believe it! Acting is poor from beginning to end ( it\'s sad to see McDonald, one of the actors from ""THELMA & LOUISE"", in it ). The funniest part is to know that the ""SKULLS"" are highly secret. But the new recruited students accepted into it each receives a brand new Porsche, Ferrari, Thunderbird or whatever !!! Second funniest part is to know that the society is so well-organized that their leaders keeps a tape showing a cold murder is the same place and manner as all the others surveillance tapes they have !!! The duel sequnce in the end almos made me laugh, I thought it was a comedy. As for Joshua Jackson acting, forget it..."

2638,0,"It's no mystery: This film lacks any of the suspense or intensity that makes good thrillers memorable. Cohen claims it is a message film aimed at teenagers headed toward college. The message I took away from it is find a better script before you start making your movie or it will wind up like this -- hackneyed and predictable.There are plenty of implausibilities and downright silliness, not to mention groaners in the dialogue and some serious over-acting.But if you think this movie is bad, just check out the sequel..."
2639,0,"SKULLS - IT WILL MAKE YOU LAUGH OR BE ANGER: This movie is mean, man ...!!! It was clearly made with the best of intentions: a history about a Secret Society and a young man ( Jackson in his worst performance ever ) trying to get out of it.

2640,0,"After 6 editions, give it up.: I watched this book grow from drill and kill in earlier editions to its present, bloated 6th edition. I have taught out of the 5th and 6th editions of this book for 4 years. The students absolutely hate it. It is cluttered and confusing. The order in which grammar and vocabulary are presented defy logic and all current research in second language acquisition. This book has been torn down and put back together so many times, that it is a hellish mess. Language methodology has changed and evolved over the nearly 25 years this book has been in use, and now this book doesn't know what it is or wants to be. The exercises in the book are worthless. All the instructions are in Spanish from chapter 1 on, and the students cannot interpret them, which renders the activities useless. Dicho has had a good, long run. It's time to shelve it and move on. The only reason I still use it is because I have no choice in textbook selection where I teach."

Because the complete workbook must consists of two parts: the written part and the conversation part. But the version sold by Amazon consists of only the written part which is not required by the teacher. So when I made a complaint to you, you sent me the same version again. This is a waste of time and money. I dont understand why your version is not the same as the one sold by the CCSF? I have no alternative but to return the replacement but to keep the first copy that I have paid, because I have already used part of it and you cannot replace me with the one I want.Willis Zhoe"
2645,0,"Buy something else: Do yourself a favor and don\'t bother with this book. It starts out as the dream novel every baseball fan has been wishing for since ""Shoeless Joe."" But, it quickly disintegrates into a story of friendship, true love, self-indulgence, and over-the-top cliche baseball drama.Another reviewer spoke of misspelled street names - even worse Mark McGwire\'s name is spelled incorrectly twice (McGuire - what MS Word suggests as the correct spelling). How can anyone respect a baseball book that spells a Hall of Famer\'s name wrong twice - what\'s next Babe Rooth?"
2646,0,I Wanted to Like it: The book is readable but by the end I was wishing I hadn't wasted the time spent reading it. The author creates a character in Russell Bryant who is a sportswriter who doesn't really seem to like his job or sports in general. He's not a likeable character to begin with and the choices he makes throughout the story make him even less so. But at least he's realistic. The character of Casey Fox is a complete fairy tale. A rookie catcher who is inexplicably the greatest ballplayer of his generation even though he quit little league and didn't play baseball again until college. So he leads the Red Sox as they chase down the Yankees in the pennant race - despite several of his outlandish and childish stunts.The ending is utterly ridiculous and made me want to give up on reading altogether.
2647,0,"A Career Minor Leaguer?: Being partial to the Red Sox, and catchers, I thought this might be the one. The book has a promising start as Casey Fox and his Boswell Russ first cross paths at a college baseball game, and it continues to fulfill the potential for quite some time but ultimately sputters out, like a minor leaguer who gets hung up at the AA level. There is much to like, including the exploration of the Red Sox conundrum and the state of the Game, but it unfortunately veers into the pedantic. Two of the main characters are drawn well enough to hold the reader's interest, but the female lead is flat, a disappointment."

This meal is called a seder , from a Hebrew root word meaning ""order,"" because there is a specific set of information that must be discussed in a specific order.In this book, the story is told first, then the four questions are asked. I think the authors could have kept the fun in this but done a better job following the correct order."
2654,0,"realistic story, but unentertaining delivery: This story might have been fleshed out better on stage in a play or a documentary. The story was realistic enough and the acting was decent but as a movie,it wasn't entertaining. The story telling wasn't good. i disliked the soundtrack, and the way the screen would pan to become a photo/or a still. It seemed reminiscent of a home movie or the backdrop of an cheesy KaraOK video. But i understand that this was the film maker's first attempt and i guess everyone has to start somewhere. 4 Stars for effort. For entertainment value or the film's ability to grab me viscerally, 2 Stars."
2655,0,"Feels like a Grade-C film school project: This production is not only an example of bad indie filmmaking, but Fitzgerald appears to have taken her film class lectures on the use of slow motion and stop motion a little too close to heart. With this mash, the library of lesbian cinema gets another addition to the bulging shelf of plots about unfaithful, betraying women -- a theme that seems to have become almost mandatory for the genre. And in what guide to creating low-budget lesbian theme films is the chapter that suggests it's a good idea to also add a soundtrack of embarrasingly second-rate songs? The whole production feels as if it was slapped together from disjointed takes and in some scenes Veronica Mittenzwei looks tired and aged. Kate Clinton's brief appearance isn't simply wasted, it's also monotonous. Sit through this if you must (at the least you'll learn what not to do if you should feel an urge to make your own video quickie)."
2656,0,"Probably the worst film I've ever seen: Not quite sure why I watched this all the way through - really wish I hadn't. Full of cliches and incredibly predictable. The chemistry between the two leads was good, but the rest was pure crap. Sorry, those who worked on this film. Just my opinion."

2658,0,"Very, very difficult to care.: This book came to me very highly recommended. I gave it my best effort. I'm highbrow, I mean, I can endure all kinds of dull things if there's lurking merit, but I couldn't endure this. The characters are flat. The narrator is about as likeable as that of _American Psycho_. It's Cheever without the wit. Old-school New Yorker types leading New Yorker lives. I couldn't stand listening to this woman if she was sitting next to me in a restaurant or coffee shop and for the same reason I don't want to read a book from her point of view: She has nothing to say. So, zero points for content, maybe half a point for eloquence. The back page, rather than profile the author, describes the font in which the book is printed, and if it was worth my time I'd explore the ways in which that's appropriate for this abysmal, cheerfully decadent story collection."
2659,0,"One-trick-pony fiction with a truly annoying protagonist: I bought this book on the strength of the NY Times review and regretted it. The perspective and appeal of these stories are very narrow. I found myself bored with the privileged, neurotic protagonist and her comments on the inconveniences of modern life for the upper classes. A search for organic coffee in the Hamptons does not great fiction make. This territory has been covered by other New York writers and entertainers (notably Jerry Seinfeld) in a much more imaginative and entertaining fashion. Laugh out loud funny? It's not. The quality of the writing is unexceptional and does not redeem the one-trick-pony story line"
2660,0,"One of the Worst Books Ever: I read a lot of books and this is really one of the worst I have ever read. There is no plot, no likeable characters and no point. I will admit, there were a rare few sentences that made me smile because I suppose they were mildly ammusing, but over all this book was a complete bore. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could start something worthwhile. I would only recommend this book if you would like to read about a completely confused and neurotic woman who needs some serouis mental help."

2665,0,"Superb book, bad edition: Godfrey Lienhardt's Divinity and Experience is a classic and sensitive ethnography of Dinka religious life. This 2003 paperbook reprint by Clarendon (Oxford University Press), however, does a great disservice to Lienhardt by eliminating the plates that were present in previous editions! Plus, the $95 list price is borderline criminal. I would give this edition zero stars for omitting the plates and the exorbitant price, but out of respect for Linhardt's magnificent work, I am giving a rating of two stars in order to spare him the indignity of a lowest possible rating. Do yourselves a favor and buy a cheap used copy of this edition or pay the few extra dollars for an earlier edition that includes the plates."

Well, there are 8 sections with different primary language entries, but unfortunately, as a native Chinese speaker and a student in linguistic field, I cannot figure out the way the Chinese words are organized, neither by pronunciation nor stroke number. For example, in the Chinese section, ther first word is ""juji"" (to gather), the second one is ""ju-zhi-xianwei"" (polyester), and the third one is ""tui"" (leg). I don\'t see any logic in this sequencing, linguistically or realistically. There is no instructions explaining this works. So, there is no way for me to use this dictionary. Judging from my limited Japanese knowledge, the Japanese words are not arranged in alphabetical order either. If this is also true for the Korean section, 3/8 of this book is not usable."

2668,0,"Fascinating Topic, Difficlut Read: Margulis and Sagan's theory of how organisms share genetic material to create new species is worth considering. Sadly, instead of giving us the theory, the evidence and the implications in a coherent flow, the book is staggers from one topic to another, oftentimes leaving you to wonder what any paragraph has to do with the one before it or, for that matter, the subject of the book. These many discontinuites make this a difficult read. In addition, the authors use many terms which the lay reader may not know, and which do not appear in their limited glossary. In the first ten pages of the book I ran across polyploid, archaebacterium, eubactierium, and karyotic fissioning (which the authors promise to explain in chapter 12!). The diagrams are also disappointing, including one which gives a color code for a black and white diagram."
2669,0,"Unpleasant and Unconvincing: I\'m usually pretty forgiving when it comes to evolutionary ideas but I simply found this book unpleasant and unconvincing. The authors derided many scientists who don\'t seem to agree with them. That\'s pretty arrogant since the idea of evolutionary symbiosis seems overstated and many related arguments weak. For example, the authors assert that many terms such as ""group selection"" are pseudoscientific. That\'s code for ""I don\'t agree with it"" which only means the authors don\'t really understand it. Another sentence, for example, refers to a ""student-infested house"". Why pounce on students? Do the authors think that\'s cute or funny? To assert their own ideas, they also denigrate Darwin and present him as some muddy thinker. Oh please! Even though Acquiring Genomes has a 150 year head-start on Darwin\'s Origin of the Species, the latter is still a much more convincing read."

I realized that during the depression was a really hard time for people, one book is enough for the topic of the depression. I believe if I had to get some sleep then I would just read this book. The one great thing aboout this book is that it showed human kindness to others no matter what their profession is."
2673,0,"Cannery Row: My opinion of the book is that is was too long and extremely too boring. It kept going to different subjects it made no sense at all. But there were some good parts in the book, like how everyone wanted to do something go for Doc. Mack and the boys were respected by everyone in Cannery Row they were like the town bums."
2674,0,"Cannary [row] ( Cannary row): Cannery row wasn't in my words the most exciting book I have ever read(throwing slabs of meat against a wall would of been more amusing), but it wasn't the worst book I have ever been forced to absorb(The giver). If you're an adventure seeking reader(like me)this book is probally not for you....especialy if you're forced to read it for english class! Perhaps if the writter had worded the book a little differently it would of been better...*stops and thinks*(possibly...not...)*sweet drop*. Now that I'm done slammin on the book I might as well not scare you off to bad(you poor souls who have to suffer as I have)! There is one interesting part in the book, its the part where Mack and da boys get drunk and trash Doc's place! thats all I'm telling you! Your gonna have to tape your eyelids open and read it yourself!!!*laughs maliciously*"
2675,0,"Nice descriptions of Montery Bay area and little else.: Nice descriptions of the Monterey Bay area where the book takes place and very realistic characters is about all you'll get from this work of Steinbeck's. What's missing is a story. The main focus is on the efforts of some bums to do something nice for Doc, a kind but lonely marine biologist who was apparently based on Steinbeck himself, but the book meanders from that plot line through stories about a Chinese grocery man, a quasi-French painter, a slightly bats housewife, a madam and her suicidal pimp, among many others. The only thing they really have in common is where they take place. They are all largely boring. And then in the end, you do indeed wonder what the point was. THIS is a classic?"

2678,0,"Disappointing: This is the seventh Steinbeck novel I have read, and also one of the worst (The Short Reign of Pippin the VII is worse). I loved The Red Pony and Of Mice of Men, so I branched out, reading some of his lesser known works. Big Mistake. This novella has no focus, no character you can relate to, no plot to speak of, no definitive climax, and no business being read. I daydreamed through most of it.The reason I don't give it one star is because Steinbeck, like in most of his novels, provided a great description of post-war Cannery Row, and did a decent job of presenting violence on the periphery (kind of like the news today). We see glimpses of violence but we, nor the characters are ever directly affected. Furthermore, the novel's ending is decent, comparing Doc's lonely isolation to that of a gopher being attacked while trying to seek out a mate. Unfortunately, most things leading up until the ending is uneventful, constantly interrupted by dead-end subplots, and lacking in intrigue."
2679,0,"A row of cans: Cannery Row is an okay book. I think Steinbeck threw in some unwanted and confusing chapters. If those chapters had more substance to the plot then it would be better. Out of the books I have read in school this is one of my least favorite, but not as least as the Great Gatsby. But in the book I did like the characters Mack and the boys, I liked how they were had no cares. Doc was also another likeable character. Because he was nice and like to try new things. Plus he was forgiving but sometimes to forgiving which I think is a big weakness."
2680,0,"Cannery Row review: This book was ok. One reason i didn't like it all that much really had nothing to do with the book itself, it is because any book in school i read i don't like it. So i guess that is not a really good reson for not liking the book. I'm not to sure that i liked Steinbecks way of writing. He would have odd chapters in there that didn't go with the story line. It threw me off. Then again some of those chapters were were kinda cool.If you are tired of reading the odinary kinda book and are looking for a change i say read Cannery Row. I myself woould not recomend this book."
2681,0,"BORING: Steinbeck spends far too much time describing the setting instead of a plot. I kept waiting and waiting for ANYTHING to happen and nothing did.

2688,0,"A diverting read: This is the first of Perez-Reverte\'s novels that I have read. I found his descriptions of Seville interesting and the plot was engaging. I was a bit put off by the fact that all of his priests, monsignors, bishops, etc., (even the ""good guys"")readily admitted an utter lack of faith in the Church they purported to represent; but I still found the book well worth reading. Having seen from some of the other reader-reviews that this is considered by some to be Perez-Reverte\'s weakest book, I look forward to reading the others."
2689,0,"A o.k read but not a suspense or mystery: I read this with great anticipation and was let down.

In fact you begin to forget the mystery."
2690,0,"cliche ridden, weak characters, simple plot, awful!: I was looking forward to an intelligently written novel What a disappointment this book was. I couldn't believe that anyone enjoyed this weakly written novel. It reqired no thought and in fact I was annoyed by all the cliches. The first rule of writting was ignored by this author.I can't finish his book because I am bored by his poor writing skills."
2691,0,"A lack of communion: Having read and tremendously enjoyed both The Club Dumas and The Flanders Panel by Reverte, I looked forward to another labrythine and intellectual tale. I was highly disappointed. The plot, or lack of one, is bad enough. Then, I could not decide if Reverte wanted to present a philosophical treatise or a mildly comic novel (clearly, he missed both points, if he was even aiming at them!). I will now approach his books with far more caution than I would have previously. If you enjoyed the two I mentioned above, save your time and money on this one."
2692,0,"The Plot is Wafer-Thin: it is perhaps appropriate that the bulk of this novel takes place in a musty old Spanish church in the act of being restored, as the writing a plotting here are as musty as the material. It pains me to say this, as I loved Perez-Reverte\'s ""Flander\'s Panel"" and ""The Club Dumas"". But what those two books carried in flair and style, this one replaces with dull characters and a plodding pace."
2693,0,"Don't waste your time: This book was highly recommended to me but turned out to be a major disappointment. The characters were one dimensional, the mystery was less than compelling and the writing was sub-par.

2695,0,"Yuck: A real letdown. Club Dumas was somewhat interesting, so I picked this up. In Seville Communion, the writing is lame and incredibly flawed, there's little feel for Seville (except that it smells like oranges, ok, I get it already), the characters are cardboard, and the plot is thin and obvious, except when it gets to the end, where it's just ridiculous. A total waste of time. This is the sort of thing Dean Koontz would've tossed off 20 years ago. I guess I was expecting more from a Spanish writer."
2696,0,"Whodunit? - Who Cares?: Nothing irks the mystery reader more than noodling through a somewhat logically-derived story, only to be served a ridiculous ending like that offered by Reverte in The Seville Communion. Frankly (and I'm about to give the mystery away here, so be warned), the ending - the whodunit - made more sense before the last page, which served only to insult the reader. Yes, I know, the priest was playing the martyr. The point is, Vespers made more sense as Methusela than the young nun. I can't possibly be the only one who thinks this, am I? I concur heartily with other reviewers who found the writing tediuous, the characters linear and wholly noncompelling, and the plot/story absurd. In addition, I found Methusela to be a half-baked version of Walker Percy's Father Smith, though Reverte's Smith wasn't nearly as compelling or intelligent as Percy's. In my estimation, Reverte has yet to write anything quite worth investing time or money into reading."
2697,0,"I can only hope this book was better in the original Spanish: I must have missed something that others got from this book. I found this book BORING! The characters, especially the comic relief trio, were incredibly inane. It was obvious who was the killer and the hacker about 25 pages into the book. I am sorry that I wasted electricity powering a light to read this book by. Upon finishing this book I quite cheerfully hurled it into the garbage."
2698,0,"Where's the beef?: This is quite an enjoyable book, but it never gets into top gear. The pages turn over quite quickly, but neither the plot nor the characters are convincing or particularly interesting. There are too many characters and most of these are rendered purely for comic effect. The shabby villains are very reminiscent of the losers who perform similar functions in Graham Greene's early thrillers. They may work as amusing caricatures and one might argue that the book's collection of failed flamenco singers and useless ex-bullfighters is ironic - a mockery of other countries perceptions of Spain, but the book needs more than irony, jokes, lustful priests and glamorous aristocrats. Neither the Vatican nor the computer angles are rendered with much conviction and there are many long passages that add nothing to the slim plot or our understanding of the characters."
2699,0,"Half Baked at Best: While I am a BIG fan of Perez-Reverte's work, The Seville Communion was a big let down. I have come to expect more from this literary master.I found the plot and the characters stilted and i could not even finish it. The plot could not hold my attention and I found myself more intruiged with doing the laundry than finding out who dunnit.I hope that Perez-Reverte's next book picks up the pace and is more akin to his first two books. My best advice for this book is don't bother."

The headset paired once after multiple attempts. Then It would not turn off or ON or do anything. All I got was a blinking blue light. From reading the reviews it seems that the controller freezes and the only way to get it working again is to open it up, unsolder the wire from the battery, wait and then reattach it.

2707,0,"Inspired work of fiction: I have studied late Ch'ing dynasty in detail from Chinese sources and can safely say that I have never encountered a more distorted and fictional view of the period. Seagrave's thesis that the 'evil legend' of Tz'u-hsi was invented by Bland and Backhouse is false: apart from the material based on the Ching-shan diary, virtually everything in 'China under the Empress Dowager' is based on authentic Chinese sources. Seagrave creates an imaginary political scenario of a court dominated by a fictitious 'Ironhat' clique. Virtually every page in this book contains some sort of error, distortion, sweeping judgement based on minimal evidence, fabrication or even an ocasional barefaced lie. If you want a true picture of the late Ch'ing, read Marina Warner's biography of Tz'u-hsi. A comprehensive and accurate account can be found in the five-volume 'Ch'ing-tai t'ung-shih' by Hsiao I-shan. Seagrave's book is an entertaining novel."

A fish from Xibalba (the underworld) appears, and he meets his dead twin brother and mother. Eventually, they decide someone must be sacrificed. I didn't really like this story because some parts were disgusting, and I didn't like the plot either."
2714,0,"Weak Plot Hurts Mayan Novel: Heart of a Jaguar is well written with reasonably good descriptions, but does not have a good plot. On the back of the book, it talks about how the city is having a bad drought and they try sacrificing a dog, but it doesn't bring rain, and will they ask Balam to make the greatest sacrifice of all? When I read this it told me exactly what would happen in the end, but I won't give it away. None of the stuff on the back of the book happened until some time near the end. Random events occured up to the ceremony that weren't that important to the story. This book is accurate with what the Mayan culture was like, but has a very bad plot. Also, this book gets very descriptive with the bloody descriptions when it is not incredibly important. Overall, I didn't really like this book"
2715,0,"Heart of a Jaguar: I think that this book is an ok book. The author describes the characters and scene well. He uses vivid words to describe the setting. He created a good plot and you could never set the book down. The characters are very adventurous. All the characters have their own personality with different characteristics.There are scenes in which you feel like you are really there. He makes the violent parts dramatic and scary. The author can get carried away at parts but he keeps you hooked through the whole book. You could almost cry at the end. He makes you terrified at violent parts, like you are watching everything happen. There are also some gross parts, when you wish you never read."
2716,0,Heart of a Jaguar review by a Rapine expert: The book heart of a Jaguar is really weird. It's about a boy named Balam; he lives in a villiage near Chichen Itza. There was a terriable drought. The people in Balam's villiage has to please the god with sacrifices inorder to get rain.It has a lot of violence thorough out the book.
2717,0,"EAGLE school review (a student): Heart of a Jaguar was a fun book to read, but I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who doesn't like violence. This book is not gory except for a few scenes which are really bloody. I gave this book 2 stars (I would have given it 2.5, but I can't) because I am not a gory and bloody person. The book is a good read (about 210 pages). I liked most of the book, but some was not my favorite(the bloody parts).Heart of a Jaguar is about a boy who lives in a village around the time of the Maya. His village is near Chichen Itza. The main problem in the book is the village is having a drout. The village needs water to grow maize and the gods won't provide rain. They do may rituals and sacrifices but it isn't enough. Balam kills a Jaguar but it may not be enough. Will the Jaguar bring rain and what will happen to Balam? Read Heart of a Jaguar to find out."
2718,0,"an ok story but sort of disgusting: In this book, there is a drought in Balam's village. It tells about Balam's life in the Yucatan, and their strugle to bring the rains. Balam is eager to become a man, and he kills a jaguar, thinking that this will please the gods and bring the rains. However, it does not.This book depicted a lot of violence, blood and gore, and had a sad ending. I would not recommend it to people who don't handle blood well."
2719,0,Bad book is NASTY: I think that the book was not very good. Its plot was the same as alot of other things that I have seen and read. It was about a boy growing up in a Mayan family. He is trying to become a man. The town is at a major water loss and they need to make a sacrifice. The end of the book is where you find out what the major sacrifice that they need to make is. I did not like the book because it is very nasty in a couple of ways. One of the main ones is goriness. All in all this book has a very usual plot and is nasty and not a good book.

In short, if you do not like taking the Lord's name in vain, and coarse language in general, don't waste your time on this movie. It, also, is nothing like the old Westerns where the good guy was good and the bad guy was bad. In this movie, it seems that every one is bad, or willing to ignore morality when it would seem to benefit them at the moment. So much for honesty, character, valor, chivalry or any other virtues; they don't seem to be of concern in this movie."

I began watching the film with no real expectations, but still happy that I might have stumbled upon some cinematic gem at 2 or 3 in the morning. But as the movie progressed I could only justify my further viewing of it as the choosing of a lesser ""evil"". Sadly, this movie joins a long list of other films where a cornucopia of talent was assembled, but the result was.... So many of the actors in this film are wasted on the material given them, and the only perfomance that really makes an impact (Brando\'s) is simply laughable. One can catch a glimpse of the sad state Brando\'s career will ultimately reach while watching this film. I\'m not even going to get started on the dull, meandering plot. Basically, just don\'t watch this movie, at least if there\'s something else better on...like a Juiceman infomercial."

Marlon Brando was at his worst in acting, as was the case with Vivian Leigh. The French Quarter of New Orleans never looked worse, and the story-about a school teacher who had an illicit affair with one of her students- was also sick. I saw it once and regretted having done so. For many reasons it\'s far from being recommendable."
2729,0,"Abusive man alert: I'm not generally impressed with plays and movies of this era, as they portray a time when it was considered acceptable for men to treat women as property. Women endured physical as well as emotional and psychological violence, without a inkling that something may be wrong about that. When Blanche encourages Stella to leave Stanley after he hits her after the poker game, I agreed very firmly with her. I was amazed that Stella returns, and that she still stays with him after what he does to Blanche near the end of the play. Blanche is written as flighty and slutty and her final fate is galling because I believe she's the only character in the play with a lick of sense. I found myself reading this quite quickly because I just wanted it over with. The whole thing repulsed me."
2730,0,"no good choice: The choice of copies of _The Streetcar Named Desire_(required reading for high school academic Englishthis summer) seemed to narrow down to ones withlurid covers or this plain one.

2731,0,"I had to read it twice: Williams describes in the play different characters and the life of those three characters. There is Blanche, a sentimental woman who is afraid of the light and on the other hand there is Stanley, Stella's husband who is a rude man and likes gambling and drinking. Between these two characters is Stella Blanche's younger sister who really loves her husband and who does everything for him and couldn't live without him. I think it's difficult to get these three characters together for a play with a lot of tension as Williams did. When I read the end for the first time I was a bit surprised because it sounded really brutal. But now I have read it again and I think it's the best thing for Blanche to live in this mental hospital because there she can live her own life."
2732,0,A Streetcar going nowhere: Personally I only got this book because I needed it for an assignment.

It is tedious reading, and dull for the most part. The book never really establishes a plot line. It shifts through a listless struggle between Aubrey and Maturin\'s romantic aspirations, and then back to Jack\'s dicey struggle with his chain of command. The book confuses and makes painful reading at times. It lacks the sublime feeling I had from reading other volumes in the series."
2735,0,"Disappointed with O\'Brian\'s ""Post Captain"": I found Patrick O\'Brian\'s ""Post Captain"" to be a plodding and literary ""dense"" read. I spent more time trying to decipher the archaic prose and search for sailing terminology definitions, then actually reading and enjoying the book. Also much of the ""action"" took place on land - another detraction from a high seas naval adventure. Much more readable and enjoyable are C.S. Forester\'s Horatio Hornblower novels that will transfer the reader to the age of ""wooden ships and iron men"" without the ponderous wording or having to master the British Seamanship Rules of Sailing Terminology.Glad I borrowed O\'Brian from the local library... and was not out any money! Beat to quarters... but steer clear of this one!"
2736,0,"I hope the rest of the series is better...: I was amazed by Master and Commander and resolved to read the entire series.

It can make for some rugged reading.Still, the book is worth the effort. I am just not sure the full enjoyment is available to those who are not intimately familiar with sailing and with sailing a vessel during the Napoleonic era.And who am I to judge a book? Because I spent money to buy it."

Your technical knowlege is not sufficient to save you. Were I a Gentleman, I should challenge you at the next opportunity. Enough!"
2740,0,schizophrenic: This is one of the worse novels I have ever read - The writing is so broken apart it seems that pages must have been pulled out of the book.

Unfortunately, there is a lump about an inch below the upper slots in the middle of the seat where one of the latching straps is attached to the rear of the seat. She felt this through a light winter coat. I had to put padding between the seat and the seat cover to prevent the bump from bothering her.If a child is smaller enough for you to use the lower strap holes they probably won't feel the lump as it will be between their shoulders and their neck. However, if they are large enough to require the use of the upper strap holes they will have the lump pressing against their spine."

However, it is very difficult to adjust and the way it sits in our vehicle causes my son's legs fall asleep every time he rides in it. The straps are dependent on each other, so as you try to loosen one side you have to tighten the other. It takes a lot of fussing around with to get the straps tightened securely. Our son is currently in an Evenflo Triumph and the knob tightening system on that is a pain also, so I think it is time to pay the price for a Britax, just for the ease of use. Luckily, the booster was purchased at Costco and they will take it back used and all for a cash refund!"

I also felt that this book's section on calculation review was written to sell the calculations manual available from the same series. If you haven't done serious calculation work for some time, this is not the review for you. I use calculutions frequently as I work, and even so, these authors managed to make me question my ability. There are probably better review books available, but I was too cheap to buy another after spending $35 on this one."

There were strengths that weren't listed, incorrect strengths listed, and the use of the drugs was vague to questionable. The practice tests also differ from the actual certification test.

Honestly, the book is just a complete waste of money. It is only 170 pages or around there while the other books are over 400 pages. The book is also useless in preparing for the exam because I didn't pass by using this book. It does not mention drug interactions or touch on it unlike Del Mar's book. This book is a piece of crap. Do not buy and waste your money. You will not pass the exam if you buy this one because it barely expands on the topic. I recommend Del Mar's book because it has the most pages ever (600 pages.)

Maybe if you invested your time in reading all the books in this series you might feel an emotional attachment to these characters but from reading this one book I didn\'t.

I could be slightly biased after reading the ""Lymond Chronicles"" if you want challenging, here\'s the series for you. Exciting and breathtaking and not enough words to describe the series.

The plot (what there was of it) moved at a snail's pace, and kept getting interrupted by naturalist lectures and other really boring asides between the characters. There was more than enough going on with nautical terms that had me scratching my head in puzzlement, and that certainly took away from the reading enjoyment. Nothing much happened in the book, and it went through several hundred pages for this nothing to finally come to an anticlimactic end. Mr. O'Brian certainly has his rabid fans, but I for one will not join them!"

Also, I accept that the vast amount of detail missing at the end of the book may be found in the next of the series. I thought - and still wonder - that maybe there are omission of paragraphs, pages, and possibly chapters from the printing I have.I was looking for a stand alone story, not a book I would need to read nine before-hand and one or more afterwards to ""finish"".If you want to read one book to decide if you like the series, this is not the one."
2759,0,"Not one for the time capsule: The 10th book in the Aubrey-Maturin seagoing series. This was my least favorite so far in the series. O\'Brian\'s books are always episodic, rather than plot-driven, but this story seemed even more of a collection of random incidents than usual. In this book, the Surprise is sent to protect the British whaling fleet in the Pacific. Along the way, there\'s adultery, a murder, a shipwreck, sharks, a lesbian band of runaway Polynesian women, and much, much more. Maybe O\'Brian had writer\'s block and a deadline when he wrote this one, or maybe he was just ""having us on."""

After installing I used the tester in the plug to check the left and right indicators and the running light -- all worked fine.

There doesn't seem to be much happening so far and barely any dialogue. The descriptions are long-winded and put me to sleep and seem to take precedence over any kind of plot. I don't really care one way or another about the characters so far as I did in her previous books. I'm wondering if the author is trying out a new style. If so, I miss her old style.

Although she created none of the patterns, she is seen modelling almost every one, with her leering face on practically every page.The history of crochet section is not original. In fact, much of it is a rehash of a truly great crochet book, ""Encyclopedia of Crochet"" by Donna Kooler.The instructions are confusing for a beginner and Ms. Stoller flatly refuses to acknowledge left handed people.

2770,0,"Good idea, but too much errata!: I'm an advanced crocheter and I've worked up several of the patterns in this book. While I love the hip designs and great explanations of the various stitches, the errata in the patterns leave me banging my head against the wall and spending lots of money on yarn for projects that have to be re-worked to get the desired end result. Debbie Stoller doesn't post the pattern errata online (maybe because she didn't write the patterns herself? I don't know), so obtaining corrected patterns is not an option. I'm rating this book low on the star scale as the purpose of this book is to successfully work the patterns and be proud with the end result, is not easily acheived with the errors."

That being said, unless you are an experienced crocheter (or know one), put away your wallet and save yourself the time-- the hours-- you will spend ripping back and puzzling over instructions: VERY POORLY WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS and errors galore.

2772,0,"Cute Patterns, but Not for a Beginner: I was so excited to get this book--Finally a crochet book with cute patterns. Here's the problem--I am not a beginning crocheter and I had problems understanding some of the directions. On the more complicated patterns, they just are not clear enough. On top of that, there are so many errors that you'd better check the errata page for this book before beginning ANY pattern. When you have pages on other websites dedicated to co-crocheters trying to help one another figure out how to work through a pattern, I'd say you have a problem. Still, several of the patterns are cute. So, if you have a very good handle on crochet and reading patterns--and you have a lot of patience, go for it! If you really are a beginner, go for something that was edited better!"

Some of the illustrations are wrong too.There are tons of updates on their website for the ""correct"" patterns (they call them erratas) - but what a pain to have to cross things out and re-write them. Isn\'t that the point of buying a pattern book, so that you have an easy reference?I purchased as a gift for my sister who is learning to crochet. The first half of the book is written for the beginner, with detailed instructions. She was so frustrated, after spending hours on a project, only to find it wasn\'t working. (it was after investigation I found the erratas)This book is headed for the recycle bin"

And by off I mean, holy cow, how did this get into publication being so flawed?? Somethings I was able to just ""wing it"" and others... not so much. The book isn\'t a total waste, but if you don\'t go into it knowing of the flaws then you\'re in for a nasty shock in some cases. I would recommend getting this book second hand, but for full price? Not so much."
2775,0,Not worth the hype: I have seen this book way overstocked at the book store and wondered what the fuss was about. I happen to my neighbors garage sale and saw that she had it for $2.00. I got home and tried it but it was too cutesy to follow. Thank god I only paid $2.00.
2776,0,"DIDN'T do it for me: I got this book, because I heard such great reviews on the other books. However, I am completely turned off by this book. I will look to the other crochet titles for what I am looking for as a beginner."
2777,0,Copy of other peoples' work: This book from title right through to content is a copy of other peoples' work. If you want a good crochet book to learn from I suggest Vogue Knitting on the Go: Crochet Basics (Vogue Knitting On The Go) by Trish Malcolm.
2778,0,"great book incorrect instructions: This book is great as far as instruction on how to chrochet and she actually has stylish hip projects that you would really wear and fool others that they were purchased and not a homemade project. However upon making one of these projects I began to realize that the instructions were incorrect. I went to the Stitch n' Bitch website and there were corrections for the FIRST edition. Mine was the second and still contained errors. I emailed the author at the email listed on the site and received no aknowledgement on how to complete the error filled pattern. I winged the project myself and it turned out okay, but I wouldn't recommend the book as the correction page on her web site was extensive and I worry that other projects will still be problematic which is frustrating when so much time is involved in doing them."
2779,0,"Editor needs to take another look: This books has so much potential, but I was severely disappointed by all the errors in the patterns. It literally makes it difficult to follow. They are such cute projects, and it is a shame, but I don't recommend this book until it has a make-over. The errata page on [...] has errors, too. (for errata: [...]"

2781,0,"I totally understand why there are so many in the store.....: This book had so many on the shelf, I thought it was new. I understand now. Poor instructions and the writing style makes you think you are watching something on cable access. Poorly done."
2782,0,"Not for beginners, but nice pictures: I'm a complete beginner and found some of the instructions and explanations obtuse and cryptic. I ended up pulling out a 'Learn to Crochet in a Day' pamphlet I picked up 10 years ago where I found really detailed explanations for the absolute beginner. The book is slick and looks nice, but I was disappointed in the content. The fluff about the origins of crocheting could have been omitted."
2783,0,Needs some serious updates: Learning to crochet can be tedious and frustrating. It's hard to be enthusiastic about learning when the patterns you have to work on are for garments you would never ever wear.
2784,0,"Too Many Mistakes In This Book: I have been crocheting for years, and teach a crochet group. Members of the group, and I bought a copy of this book. We are very disappointed with all the mistakes in the book. I even had to go online to get corrections of the mistakes in the book."

2786,0,"Filled with logical inconsistancies: It was no secret that K had a long term relationship. He told some of his close friends about it. It's a private matter anyway. Radha's account on the other hand is not an expose, it is a nasty, malicious character attack of a man who is dead and can't defend himself.Her book is filled with logical inconsistencies: conclusions that simply do not add up. A book by someone who totally missed the boat for those who've missed the boat and are looking to rationalize it. Radha wrote to me that ultimately because of freedom of speech she can say anything she wants. That's how she justified the logical inconsistencies!! Too bad she didn't have the guts to do that when K was alive."
2787,0,"Assumptive,Speculative,presumptuous.: I found the book to be highly presumptuous,misleading,and bias,in favor of her parents point of view!The only thing I would suggest is that one should read Krishnamurti,and the Rajagol's by Mary Luytens.They were using the affair between K and Rosaland as a blackmail tool to keep Krishnamurti from legally exposing gross abuse of monies gifted to the work of K , by D. Raja."
2788,0,"A SLANDEROUS EXERCISE OF IMAGINATION.....: I recently read this work by Mrs. Sloss. I\'ve read many Krishnamurti works and willingly read this book as it presents a different opinion of the man. The conclusions as to Krishnamurti\'s motives, etc. are entirely imaginative in my humble opinion. It may have been a good sell had it not been so blatantly biased, basically the ramblings of a jilted lover filtered through her daughter who seeks to weave a very tall tale indeed. Shame, shame. While I would not recommend buying this book, if you must read it, borrow it instead!! In addition though, please read another book after that provides a most excellent response by Mary Lutyens called ""Krishnamurti and the Rajagopals."" Only then will you be able to determine for yourself what the real story is!..."
2789,0,"Loaded with fallacious logic: I read the book with interest and an open mind. The conclusions the author makes are often unfounded. There are some interesting historical descriptions and the most important contribution of the book was to depict that K was actually a human - and in my mind that made him even greater, because being a human he understood the human condition. But the author appears to constantly want to attack K for being a human and many of her conclusions seem to be inaccurate and unfounded - at least they are not presented with much solid logic."
2790,0,"Stop preaching your faith for a minute!: Let me say...I believe in God and try to live a spiritual life, but give me a break!Had a difficult time getting through this one. Ms. Fuller spends WAY too much time going on about religion, faith and God and not nearly enough time on the idea of teaching kids about music which is why I picked up the book! If I wanted a book on spirituality, I would've gotten one! It seems that every turn, Fuller is finding some excuse to go on about her religious fervor.Why do some Christians feel that they have to hit us over the head with their faith?I was very disappointed at all the dogma I had to wade through to get to what the book was SUPPOSED to be about!I would suggest that you try to find another book on this topic before trying this one."
2791,0,"Badly organized not enough detail: I work as an Apps DBA. I happened to get a hold of this book and read thro' it to see if it contained anything useful. Its awful. Its badly organized.There is no explanation on the architecture, no examples on how to use the adutilities and when to use them. Its very theoritical and not practial.There is more emphasis on windows (I havent heard of many decent sized businesses running oracle applications on windows)"

2796,0,"disappointed: I have read Sandra Dallas's other books and loved them.This was very disappointing. I kept reading and hoping it would get better, but it did not. If it had been the first of her writings for me to read, it would likely have been the last. I am glad I saved it for last, because I really loved her other work."
2797,0,never a good shave: It took me longer to shave with this razor than it does to shave with a blade. I always had razor burn after using this. If you want a good shave get a safety razor.
2798,0,Disappointing: This shaver was defective and had to be returned to seller. I did receive full refund (minus shipping).
2799,0,"Not happy with this car seat: I purchased this seat after it received a favorable review from Baby Bargains. I was fairly happy with the seat at first -- it reclines much more than our Britax seat and is good for long trips with a baby. The fabric seems cheap and the straps and buckle are difficult to work with, though. After approximately six months of use, we went to turn the seat forward and found that the seat foam was actually disentegrating under the outer cover. I had to vacuum out the car to get it all up (and I've never even put the cover through the wash). I'm contacting Combi to try and get a return."
2800,0,"Not a well-produced video: I was very disappointed in this video -- the script jumped around from one place to another and back again, it was not in depth, and was only 28 minutes. I found a much better DVD of the same area (not through Amazon) by Smart Travel. This truly was one of the most poorly produced travel videos I have seen -- I felt like it was a waste of my $15.Languedoc"
2801,0,"No egg roll?: Typical ""cloak & dagger"" film made way back when. Cooper walking around with a monkey was dumb. Madaline Carroll was beautiful. The russian actor made up to be Chinese, not good. Poor story line."
2802,0,"Do not bother: This book is just tripe to feed off the the ""vampire community."" Virtually all of the Egyptian references have been culled from the Temple of Set\'s Order of the Vampyre which predates this book and the ""vampire community."" If you really want to learn about vampires I suggest you look into the Temple of Set\'s Order of the Vampyre instead of white washed right hand path material such as this."
2803,0,REMAKE!!!: Do not buy unless YOU want to waste 99 cents. This is NOT the original 1983 single release at all. Re-Recorded Junk is the proper description!
2804,0,"Rip off: How could Irene Cara herself take part in this ""duet""? She probably needed the money....DJ Bobo is horrible and ruins the song"
2805,0,Cheap Cheap CHEAP: This thing was NOTHING like what I expected. The foam padding on the inside makes the PLASTIC helmet sit so high on your head that it really protects nothing. I sent mine back.
2806,0,cheep helmet: the helmet is made very cheeply and the straps to fasten the helmet are crooked. I would not recomend this product for a serious motorcyclist
2807,0,P U This season STINKS!: This series totally jumped the shark when Chase left at the end of season 3 the new guy that plays Zoey's boyfriend is really annoying. I hate all the episodes in this season and Quinn hooking up with Logan is the only saving grace out of a weak season. Thank God Jamie-Lynn got knocked up and ended the series. Chase's Dynamic really made the show = do not bother buying this season unless you are a REALLY REALLY DIE HARD FAN>
2808,0,"Less than I expected.: I received The Gershwin Songbook, ""\'Swonderful."" My complaint has nothing to do with Amazon or the supplier. I\'m just a traditionalist, and found the music and singing to be less than satisfying. As an arranger or singer, how could you possibly think your sense of rhythm or your lyrical ability could exceed that of the master? I\'m here to tell you that neither of yours did. Just play the music and sing the lyrics as they were written so the listeners can sing along, snap their fingers and reminisce about happier times."
2809,0,Wish it had worked: I wish I could say that my wife's sciatica had gone away or that it had even reduced the pain or even left it the same. In stead she has pain in additional places. We have waited in hopes (as it said in the DVD) that the body was remembering old injuries but the new pains haven't abated. We did 2 sessions a week apart. My wife is afraid to do the third.The sheet accompanying the dvd was not helpful. The pictures were poor and so close up that you often could not tell where on the body the moves were being applied. Plus no stickers shown. It would have helped also if the photographer of the DVD had stepped back more often so we could have seen the whole picture - stickers and or movement better. Especially on the boomerang and thumb chase.I believed it when they said you couldn't hurt people with this procedure.Silly Me.

2814,0,"Missed the Mark: Boy did this book leave we wanting. There is no front matter to describe how to use the book. Probably because the pages aren't organized for the user to record information useful in tasting and rating cigars. The space for placing the cigar bands is too small for most bands and the comments section is way to small to record all the pertinant information regarding taste, construction, appearance, aroma, etc. There is only one box to record the wrapper and no space dedicated to recording the binder or filler information. The filler is probably the most important regarding the taste of the cigar and yet there is no place to record this information!This book was published in 1995 and was clearly sold to make a buck during the cigar boom of the '90s. This was not made by a person in tune with those of us looking for a cigar log book with substance."
2815,0,"Absolute Trash (disappointed to say the least!): Even Trower's somewhat uneven records (Back It Up comes to mind) were far better than much of the musical output of a thousand other bands. This release, however, truly demonstrates he is A. Stuck in a time warp or B. Totally bereft of new musical ideas. The vocals are horrible - why Trower feels he can (or should) contribute vocals is a mystery. The singing chores should have been left to Livingston Brown, who has the type of voice Trower's music needs and deserves. I've seen Robin play live twice with Livingston Brown, and not having Brown's lead vocals as well as better developed/more forward thinking musical material dooms this new release (in my humble opinion). To say that much more was expected is an understatement!"
2816,0,"Robin Trower can't do without James Dewar: Robin Trower has produced the best rock/guitar albums of the last century. All his albums were great with James Dewar as singer, songwriter and bass player. After James became unfortunately ill everything that made the music special is gone. Not only his beautifull and powerfull voice is missing even the sound of Robin's guitar sounds bad without him. Jimmy and Robin were the best."
2817,0,"Trower\'s Worst CD Yet by ten million miles!: I\'m a guitarist and have been a big Trower fan since the very beginning. For the life of me, I can\'t understand how Robin has lost his ear for decent songs and vocals. For the life of me, I can\'t understand how any true Trower fan could even mention the title of this CD and ""Bridge of Sighs"" in the same sentence. This would make a decent Tom Petty album, but it makes a terrible Robin Trower album. It\'s tired, draggy, and monotonous, not even considering the ""Bob Dylan\'s grandmother"" vocals. Robin desperately needs a new vocalist and a decent songwriter. The only decent CD he\'s released in the last few years is 20th Century Blues.....and it\'s not that great....but a helluva lot better than this!"
2818,0,"Disappointed: As a big fan of Union Station and O Brother, I had high expectations for this CD. Boy, was I disappointed. Most of the songs are either trite, sappy or too religious (not traditional gospel). Big, big disappointment."
2819,0,"half good: I was disappointed with this cd. Some of the tracks are quite good in the bluegrass tradition with a bit of a modern edge. While other tracks are better described as contemporary country. In the end about half the cd, the bluegrass half, was quite good. Still, 50% is a big 'F'."
2820,0,"more bluegrass, less country please: Like many other reviewers on this page, I heard Dan Tyminski for the first time on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack as well. I was disappointed with this recording, though, because it sounds a bit too much like pop country for my taste. I\'d hoped for something that sounded bluegrassier. ""Please Dear Mommy"" I found to be overly sentimental and the God stuff is a little hard to take."
2821,0,"No need to continue further: This isn\'t going to be a long drawn out list of complaints.I\'m gonna try to keep it short.The book was just terribly uninteresting. The only exceptions being Solembum and Angela-character wise- and the last two chapters. It wasn\'t this epic adventure...it was long and mostly boring. The chapters were too short. and parts of the story too clipped. And this did not strike me as original. It seemed like it was mixed up of Harry Potter, Lord of the rings, and Merlin(The BBC series). Not to mention the word ""stymied\' came up enough to be annoying.So, in short. Didn\'t love it. Won\'t be reading books 2-4."
2822,0,book report: This book was really just a book report on Lord Of the Rings and other geat novels. he put it into his own words and changed the names around but alot of the story was based on LOTR. I didnt realize this after reading them both. Their were a few things different so I give it two instead of one
2823,0,"rip off: this thing sucks a**, it's just a rip off of the lord of the rings (which are actually very good books) the plot is too slow too dull, I keep catching things that came straight out of the Lord of the Rings. It's like some fifteen-year-old kid decided to write a novel, but he couldn't come up with anything so he ripped off a great series."
2824,0,"No good for adults, no good for kids, no good for anyone: Probably half the thousand-something reviewers on this site have said why Eragon sucks. Bad writing, dull characters, cliche plot, etc. But lots of reviewers have tried to defend Paolini's poor book by saying that it's meant for children. But is it?Allusions to rape, gory fight scenes, heroes stealing money from bridgekeepers, and a rather negative view on the meaning of life (or lack thereof in Eragon's case). And let's not forget the skewered baby that was almost eaten by a crow!Face it. It's not a decent children's book. It's a poorly written adult book."
2825,0,"This book is Auful: This book was so over hyped it\'s crazy. Let me be honest with you, it was written by a 15 year old... and it READS like it was written by a 15 year old. There\'s nothing amazing here other than that he actually got published.The name of the book ""Eragon"" is a plagiarism by itself! Ever head the name ""Aragorn"" before? Sound similar by coincidence? The main theme of the book is the ""Dragon Riders"" So we know the kid read ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Dragonlance"" before he started. I\'ll not go on... there\'s no point. The book is bad. I\'m sure when he\'s 40 he\'ll be a great writer, but that\'s 20 years away. Don\'t waste your money on this book."
2826,0,This book deserves negative 5 stars: This book is horrible. I've seen my dog deposit more original pieces of artwork on my lawn. I don't have anything else to say.
2827,0,"Lacks life: I probably would have finished this book except that it was inconvinient to do so. But from what I read, eragon doesn't really do anything wrong, but it didn't do anything new either. I can't really find anything to object to except that the book lacked life. It didn't have that spark of originality that I really want in books. If you want a good fantasy that isn't going to shock you, this is probably your best bet, but otherwise, I doubt this book would have done well if it didn't have the gimmick that it was written by a kid."
2828,0,"Save your money: Wish I'd read the first review on Amazon before buying this overhyped book. I can't say it any better then he- it is an impressive effort for a teenage author, but a poor imitation of Tolkien and McCaffrey's stories. The characters are wooden, and what really gives it away is the total lack of humor and the author taking himself and his story too seriously. Read the Bartimaeus books for a refreshing contrast. It did get me thinking about what qualities separate a good book from a bad one, though... When the author has to TELL you how the characters are feeling rather than letting their actions and dialogue speak for itself, that's one sign of a poorly written tome."
2829,0,"I didn\'t really care.: Okay, while I do think that Eragon has a few okay characters (Angela, the Werecat) the rest are just pathetic. Eragon can be discribed as ""Hero who instanly knows everything and is the best at sword fighting, snapping at other people, drinking whineing, and getting knocked out when someone taps him on the back of the head."" Come on, the talking dog in my little sister\'s picture book is tougher!Don"
2830,0,"bad, bad, bad: As we all know by now, the author was fifteen when he wrote Eragon. Whoever he showed it to should have said, ""This is a great book, kid. You should become an author when you grow up!"" But instead they went and published it.Aside from the beautiful cover, the book has almost nothing to recommend it. There are nearly no original elements. The characters have no personality to speak of, except for the dragon, who is smug. The action is patently unbelievable from paragraph to paragraph--I remember one scene where Eragon draws his bow and fires an arrow behind him to kill an opponent who\'s chasing him, and I finally quit reading when he was able to beat one of the best swordsmen in the world, left-handed, after only a few months of practice since growing up as a farm boy."
2831,0,"couldn't get into it: for the reasons others have said, I couldn't get into this book. weak dialog, ridiculously weak female characters, ripped-off plot, and I'm supposed to like it because of all the hype? I don't. I for one have nop interest in the next book whatsoever."
2832,0,"not worth it: The book is dismally written in an irritating voice. The characters are unbelievable. The plot is very predictable (almost the same as star wars). The world has been completely lifted from Lord of the rings and in the process has lost it's detailed history and grandiose mystique. I suppose it's good trashy literature for younger children, but then, there are better books that they could be reading instead."
2833,0,"Eragon: i thought this book was okay, because it sounded a lot like Lord of the Rings, with elves, dwarves, and names, such as Eragon to Aragorn. Brom seemed okay, but his having a white great horse was like Shadowfax, and there was a lord of horses in the book. I thought it wasn't bad, but it was just a little too similar to Lord of the Rings."
2834,0,"Sucks: Eragon was the worst book I\'ve ever read in my life. The concept was stolen from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. He didn\'t even add anything new to it.There\'s a difference between paying homage to something and outright ripping it off. I believe that christopher paolini should be in prison for copyright infringement. He ripped right off Star Wars, which itself wasn\'t even that good. If you\'re going to steal ideas, steal GOOD ideas.Okay, I take it back. I\'ve read books far worse than Eragon (for example, maya angelou\'s books all suck). But that doesn\'t mean that Eragon should be given leeway. And he shouldn\'t be given leeway just because he WAS a teenager. Lots of teenagers write great books. For example, Nancy Yi Fan, who became a bestselling author at age 13.I know it\'s a bit late to post about Eragon, but for those who are about to get into it, I strongly advise you to stay away from this ""novel""."
2835,0,i agree with the one sta review: the book was horrible do not waste your money there were so many bad idaes and things this book is a piece of crap! wait no tha is a dis on crap
2836,0,"Even worse in audio: I wanted to like this book - I really did! Despite being gifted with two hardcover copies, I put it off until listening to the audio version. Sorry - I can't make it past Disk 4 of 14. All of the monochromatic storytelling in print sounds even worse, aggravated by Gerard Doyle's ever-breathless, semi-falsetto voicing for Eragon. As an audio production, this work fails compared to the unabridged CDs of Rowling's Harry Potter series or Pullman's His Dark Materials."
2837,0,"Attack of the mutant modifiers: I eagerly opened this book and excitedly began reading it. After a few excruciating minutes, my wife walked by quietly.""What are you reading?"" she asked curiously.""Eragon,"" I replied discouragedly.""Why do you sound depressed?"" she inquired inquiringly.""Every other word is a damned adverb or adjective,"" I replied irritatedly.""That could be a problem,"" she replied knowingly.""Yes, it IS a problem,"" I muttered angrily. ""Nobody simply DOES something in this book, they have to do it DESCRIPTIVELY. (...)""""One might say his writing is rather prolix,"" she observed sagely.""Actually, I like the word prolix and I even use it from time to time, but yes that about hits the nail on the head,"" I declared emphatically.""How much shorter would this book be if some editor hacked off all the deadwood adjectives & adverbs?"" she mused bemusedly.""Probably about 100 pages,"" I replied speculatively."
2838,0,"My 6yr old brother could write better than this!: I am twelve years old, and have written three fantasy books. I will admit, that the first one I wrote, was based off Tolkien, and inspired by him.But this, peice of crap? It was copied from Tolkien. Pathetic! It is filled with too many pointless descriptions that come out of the blue, only to drag you away from the rocky plot. It is barely a story, mostly descriptions, and the names are all tears away from Tolkien as well.Ayra:ArwenEragon: This is /too/ obvious.And Brom is obviously molded from Gandalf.The boy, is way to unoriganal and acts like he's fourty! Everything that happens is very stereotypcial, and I had to force myself to finish it. All that happens: He gets hurt, he gets better. I could guess what was going to happen next, everything was just a cheap twist from either Star Wars or Tolkien, so in closing:DOWN WITH CRAPPY FANTASY!"
2839,0,Eragon a book?: Eragon is a horrible book but it gets boring as it goes on. Trust me this book is so boring I fell asleep trying to read it. I especially didn't like the part where Bron died. A book is no fun when a major character like Bron dies. If are going to read it I do not recommend it time and if you read it I apologies.
2840,0,"Hee, hee, hee: Paolini was obviously entranced by LOTR, and almost wrote a fanfiction story about it. A fanfiction story where Aragorn is raised by his uncle/aunt, instead of Elrond.Instead, he named the character Eragon, and created a tedious book that really shows his determination (I mean, he did manage to finish the thing)more than anything else. It's good exercise, but should've stayed in the closet that most writers keep for juvenile efforts."
2841,0,"Some sense in the plot please?: Terrible storyline seems to wander aimlessly from page to page. While reading Eragon, many a time I would find myself getting extremely irritated with Paolini and would have to remain calm by reminding myself that this is the work of a pre-pubescent teen. This is definitely noticeable within the cracks in his plot."
2842,0,"Lack of skill: In my opinion, young author Paolini lacks the skill that many famous fantasy writers posses. J.R. Tolkien is a clear example. He took the elves, urgals A.K.A. Uruk-Hai and dragons from Tolkiens' well written books. Not to mention lots of other different material Paolini so rudely stole from The Lord of the Rings. If he lacks the skill of a writer he should just leave it to other people who actually have that gift. He should not steal other brialliant writers' work."
2843,0,"too predictable: this book couldn't hold my attention. i didn't really finish it, because i just didn't care enough. everything was too predictable, one thing after another. it's all been done. if you want to read fantasy that will hold your attention, read garth nix or philip pullman"
2844,0,"Falls flat: Mr. Paolini states on his wen site that, in his writing: ""I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney\'s translation of Beowulf"". You ain\'t even close kid. You don\'t deserve to walk in Tolkien\'s shadow, and stealing ideas, names, plot devices, etc. from him will never make you a good author. Oh--one other note--some else\'s translation of a dark ages heroic epic is not something you should be striving to mimic from a stylistic standpoint--sort of like trying to capture the ""essence"" of a reproduction of a Monet. Pretty stupid when you think about it..."
2845,0,"Skip it!!: Chris Paolini and Robert Stanek must be friends. They write alike, they're stories are so similar. Both heroes even eventually go off to the land of the elves. How stupid is that?"
2846,0,"I would rate it 0...: ...because they don't have negative 1000 billion as an option. Anyone who likes this book has no imagination. It is like every other book in fantasy. If you really like dragons, you should read LOTR or this new book, Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate written by Kenneth Eng.Erragon sucks."
2847,0,"Yet another commercialized disappointment.: Forced dialogue, Poor characterization, and almost no emotional pull renders an otherwise good story into meaningless drivel. The glaze on my eyes didn't clear until after page 150. (Enough time to blink!) It always saddens me when good money is spent on something that is seemingly all hype and no substance."
2848,0,"Looking for a good book?: Well, if you are, don't choose this. Choose any of the books it's based off of. From the start, this book feels like its been recycled (Even down to the names. Aragorn/Eragorn.)I bought this book after reading a number of reviews on the web and in the paper which heralded it as an amazing work of fantasy. And yet, after reading it, I was rather... put out. It's decent, yes, but its certaintly nothing new. Honnestly, I'm impressed that parts of it even made it though editing.Anyway. If you're just looking for a book to waste time with, I'd suggest a series that is less traditional. If you're looking for good Fantasy, I'd suggest a series that's, well, good fantasy. Not a rip off of it.Anyways. Yes. If you really do want to read this book, or really any other book, make sure you check with the book reviews that focus on its genera. I know that's something I'm going to do henceforth."
2849,0,"Disappointed: I had heard so many good things about this book in a reading group I'm in. Everyone seemed to love it, so I started the book expecting another great fantasy. I still haven't finished it, but I just can't bring myself to. I am bored out of my mind while I read it, and have trouble not falling asleep. I don't really care about any of the characters or what happens to them, because I don't feel like I even know the characters. And this is after 250 pages. I feel like I'm missing something, and I wanted to make myself read the rest of the book to find out what I'm missing, but there are so many really good books out there that I just don't have the time to slog through a book I am not enjoying."
2850,0,"boring, been done, boring, been done: This book is boring. The storyline is a hodgepodge of what other authors have already done. And as some other reviwers have pointed out, the female characters are tiresome,pathetic really. Doesn't liveup to the hype. At all. Great cover, though,but if you judge by the cover you're in for bit of BIG dispointment."
2851,0,"How?: Chris needs to get some life experience first, then practice writing. Potential is not the same as original. Please, Chris, seriously consider your future. No one else seems to be."
2852,0,"Mediocre - and that's being kind: As an avid fantasy reader, I was deeply disappointed by this book. I agree with others, that there was nothing new here, everything was borrowed (stolen?) from other writers. As far as the sequel, I'll skip it. There are too many good books out there for me to waste my time reading more of this."
2853,0,"And the rave parade continues...: No way does this book have anything worthwhile in it. I'd like to get back the hours of my life lost reading this book. As for everyone saying it'll get better in the next one - I fell for it once with Eldest, won't fall for it again. Why anyone is still reading this junk is beyond me. Both my brothers gave up on this sinking junkpile - me too."
2854,0,"A book of cliches: Firts of all, i dont know why this book had a chance of being one of the top sellers. Every aspect of this book is an obvious rip off of fantasy based genres. If you happen to be new to this kind of ""ideas"", it would be a quite interesting book to read. But of course, in order to enjoy it, you MUST ignore the mediocre dialogue that doesnt seem to fit the whole dragon-king-castle era. By that i mean, what kind of medieval-old-wise man would talk like a 21st century suburban teen? And then start talking in a somewhat shakespearian speech that sounds more like David-Spade-trying-sound-like-yoda-from-starwars? But then again, its good book for novices but if your pass that...well..you\'ll see my point."
2855,0,"Not quite there: Paolini has some storytelling merit, to be sure. Why else would his book be selling well? The plotline and characters are certainly interesting. But they're not interesting *enough*--I constantly found myself capable of reading a chapter, feeling more or less entertained, and then putting it down with absolutely no subconscious need to pick it up again. Whenever I did continue reading, I wasn't bored, but I also never felt the compulsion to finish. The story is too much of a cliche, and there is really nothing about Saphira or Eragon that seemed unique enough to pull them out of the stereotypical dragon or adolescent hero-kid of mass-produced fantasy novels. The writing itself was decent, but not great. But the book was also not so bad as to make me *not* recommend it to other viewers. In a nutshell, so-so."
2856,0,"intensely boring: As a girl, I could not relate to any of the characters in this book. I like to be able to relate to at least one person. The female characters WERE all for him, him, him. Girls today know better, and stories that do this are intensely BORING to us. Mothers, if you give your daughters this book, you might as well tell them to forget about being a person in their own right. If they're beautiful and enjoy falling in love with adolescent boys for no particular reason, and then . . . BORING!! Oh poor me, I'm such a beautiful elf languishing in prison. Help me, help me. Bad enough that this book is unoriginal. It's also dull."
2857,0,"not believable: This book was a bore. It was too unbelievable and never really captured my attention. So eragon finds a dragon egg, big deal. It has an unbelievable ending to a simply bad book. ..."
2858,0,"It\'s horrible.: Really, the worst thing about the book is all the cheesy dialogue; the moment the story started with ""Stop whoever is coming...or die"" I knew I was in for a roller coaster ride of cliches. His writing and descriptions aren\'t impressive either. Writing 101: don\'t start every sentence in a paragraph with a pronoun, it\'s obnoxious, and trying to vary that up with time indicators (i.e: while, when, at that time, at that moment, in an instant), is unimaginative and mediocre. Yes, he\'s 17. So what? It\'s not impressive for a 17 year old to write like this, it would be impressive if a 12 year old wrote like this."
2859,0,"Nothing New Here: Your average ho-hum fantasy good guys win, bad guys vanquished. Cliched, poorly written. Good stuff for a tweener maybe, but don't expect to get any originality with this book."
2860,0,"Derivitive Junk: I'm not sure what fantasy/science fiction epic was not ripped off by the young Paolini to fuel his insipid young boy meets dragon story...but in the end it matters little.No matter how many great works one rips off, if the author has no unifying vision of their own, if they have nothing to say, then their book will be a mess.Eragon, and it's equally uninspired sequels are exactly that."
2861,0,"You can't judge a book by it's cover: Okay, I admit it, the cover art drew me in. Unfortunately, the writing quickly threw me right back out. This book's editor should be simultaneously disbarred and pelted with marshmallows. Wow! This book is a real stinker."
2862,0,"plagiarism...you say tomato...: Okay, so Christopher Paolini turned his thesaurus upside down and shook out a few different words, but, for all of his rearranging, he couldn\'t cover the fact that this book is completely unoriginal. Intellectual property by any other name...Those searching for a cliche can find solace in ""This book is a cure for insomnia"".It\'s been said that when a new book is published, read an old one. If you have read only the major works of fantasy, read or seen ""Lord Of The Rings"", or have even a vague remembrance of the plotline of the ""Star Wars"" movies, then take heart, for you can say with all honesty that you have read ""Eragon"".It\'s no excuse that the author is just 19. He can be tried as an adult, you know."
2863,0,"the title should warn you: I was dismayed by the title (way, WAY too similar to Aragon of LOTR) but since it's a fat fantasy, gave it a try. Kept on going, despite increasing dissapointment at words, characters, settings lifted directly from other books & movies. Stone that turns into dragon = Simak, people riding dragons= McCaffery, tuatha as magic word = Willow, old man as warrior in hiding = Star Wars, elves as beautiful guardians of the good = Tolkien, etc., etc. There were just TOO many borrowings to be credible. It was similar to the fan fiction one sees on the web, or that most of us wrote in high school. Then I find out afterwards...he WAS in high school! So that explains it all. When he finds a voice of his own, he'll be a good author, but I'm afraid this wasn't it."
2864,0,"Save Your Money: Eragon was kind of good, but mostly, I hated it. The words are too sophisticated for a kid's book, and mr paolini got most of his story from lord of the rings and harry potter. Make the right decision folks! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! Stick with harry potter and lemony snicket."
2865,0,"Way to go Kenneth: Thank you for taking the words out of my mouth. God, this book is lame. If you're seeing this, Ken, Dragons: LT is much better. Thank you."
2866,0,"Perhaps the worst book that I have ever read: To call this book bad would be an understatement, it goes beyond bad, it's outright terrible!! I can't believe that this book was even published. It was written by a teenager and it shows, It reads more like a high school project, something he had to do for an creative writing class. I'm not going to go into great detail why this book is so bad, it just is."
2867,0,"Shameless stupidity: Stupid, moronic, idiotic. I'm twelve. This is the stupidest fantasy I've read in a long time. You other young readers make me sick."
2868,0,"mediocrity doth not a fine novel make: The essence of Eragon's failure is its lack of earnestness. What Paolini has done is simply a failed amalgation of adolescent, prepubescent tales that caught his fancy. His depictions of women are ethereal, full of boyish longing. His plot flits hither and thither, from one iconic fantasy tale to another. But what is worst, beyond the sheer silliness of its subject matter and the workmanlike quality of its prose, is the mediocrity in which his subject matter is immersed. Like an adolescent preening for profundity, he simply lays naked a frightening lack of talent, and disregard for the innards of what gives true writing DEPTH. This tale skims surfaces, never plumbs the real depths of its protagonists, makes its antagonists caricatures rather than characters. A painful work to read. Adults and those of discerning intelligence--let the children read this, and have their day. Maturity awaits them down the road."
2869,0,"not original: First, I do think that this writer did have a good writing style, wich is why he gets at least 2 stars, however, the characters, especially the main character had NO PERSONALITY!!! He was so... characterless, I actually didn't care wherther he died or not! Also this books lacks originality. If this is one of this first fantasy books you've read then you might not be as dissapointed, but this book copied soooo many other fatasy books. It could actually be a fan fiction. I was really frusterated by the fact that he got so much publicity with this book, and yet... it's nothing original or special. On the other hand, the author is a good story teller. I was never bored while reading the book, but I was deffinatly dissapointed."
2870,0,"I dont get it...: I really don't get why this book is so highly praised. Yes I get that someone younger than myself wrote this book and I probably couldn't do a better job of writing it, but its NOT THAT GREAT. As everyone has been saying, it stole a bunch of ideas from other influential fantasy novels, which is fine but it poorly mooshed them all together to make a really long, dry book. Great storyline, but it could have been played up a lot more. It was too long. And it's not that I don't like long books. I love Harry Potter and the Count of Monte Cristo, but they are able to hold my attention and admiration the whole way through. This one was hard to get through. I bought the second book and still haven't read it because I'm dreading that it will be the same thing all over again. I will see the movie and hopefully that will be more exciting than the book."
2871,0,"It\'s a no-buy: For all you review-readers out there, save yourself the money and don\'t get this book. As stated by so many here before, it\'s a rip-off of, to name a few, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pern, Earthsea, etc. Paolini can\'t even make up his own language. If you look carefully at the words, they sound /strangely/ like synonyms of the word they\'re supposed to mean. Let me see, the word vonder for a thin, straight stick, can I say \'WAND\'? Or how about thrysta for thrust... arget for silver? The word for silver in latin is argentium. GET ORIGIONAL, CP.And for those who say, ""oh, he wrote it at the age of 15!"" he didn\'t. He was 19.Another fact: Look at the majority of people who gave good reviews:A. They were CHILDREN. Under the age of 13.B. MOMS talking about their CHILDREN enjoying it.Again I say, save your money and buy a better book."
2872,0,"Garbage written by a teenager is still garbage: If this book had not had a gimmick of coming from a kid, it would have been thrown on the scrap heap at any publisher and recycled. Which it should have been. This is a really terrible piece of fan fiction, and the fact that it has gotten the attention it has is a complete sin. When I first heard that a teenager had written it, I wondered if he might have had help from his parents. Now that I've seen it, I can only hope he didn't, because that means there are even more bad writers in the world than just him."
2873,0,"why this book is so popular, I will never know: Eragon has been hailed as an epic story written by a teenage prodigy, but few seem to realize the sad truth about this book and its sequel. There is barely any original plot or characters in this entire series, and it very much lacks in writing talent and ability. If it had been written by, oh say, a middle aged person who had experience in the writing field, it would have never been published. The author simply takes chunks from other, better stories such as the popular Lord of the Rings trilogy, Earthsea, the Dragon Riders of Pern, and Starwars, and pretends they are his own ideas. I highly recomend you skip this book and look for something with a little more taste."
2874,0,"Soooooooooo... BORING!!!!: When I got this, it looked like an exiting adventure story. I've got into about a forth of the book and I can't read any more! I think I'll bore myself to death! My parents forced me to read this, and I can't imagin how bad the next one, Eldest, is! DO NOT GET THIS BOOK> IT'S A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2875,0,"Too many rip-offs: As noted so many times, but perhaps not adequately emphasized, Paolini has obviously received influences from Tolkein, Eddings, Brooks, and many others; although influenece may be an understatement. This could easily be an uneducated rip-off of the Lord of the Rings. The book reads very much like it, from fantasy languages, to the naming of contrived species, to a hero who seems on the path to ""an epic romance"" with the most beutiful woman in the world (who also happens to be an elf). The epic romance bit is a direct quote from the book and shows clearly the 15-year-old mind behind all this. The only bright side is that in making the main character 15, Paolini has at least created one believable character. While there is definate potential here, Paoplini needs to start writing his own story instead of butchering his predicessors\'."
2876,0,"All of this has happened before...: and no doubt it will all happen again. Entertaining book, but really, past the 2nd chapter, I've read this book before and seen the movie before. It's Star Wars, Wizard of Earthsea, LOTR, Pern, and probably quite a few I haven't read. Sorry, this book is a blatant ripoff of MUCH better books. Read it yourself...you'll see."
2877,0,"A waste of paper: One of my friends recommended this book, so I had high hopes for it. Alas, my hopes were dashed. This book blatantly rips off elements of other major fantasy stories--mainly Tolkien and Anne McCaffrey. A main character named Eragon who is a Dragon Rider that can communicate telepathically with his dragon. Gee, how original. And all the names are so unimaginative that I'm torn between laughing and crying at the travesty (a blue dragon named Saphira? Come on!). It's pretty much a cliched travelogue. Ugh. I'm rarely moved to write reviews but this book really just blew it. If you want some good fantasy, there's plenty of much better stuff out there--try some Robin McKinley, for instance."
2878,0,"Trite Fantasy and Poor Writing: I thought this story was going to be somewhat promising since the sales rank--but IT DEFINITELY WAS ALL HYPE. I tried my hardest to like it but the poor chracters and ""cookie cutter"" story time and again defeated that. I\'ve never seen a fantasy story so unabashadly rip Tolkien--watch Fellowship the movie (or read the book) and you have the plot.One feels that he was inspired to change the names and write his \'own\' story. Inexcusable and pathetic! The more you praise this worthless tripe folks the more of this is what your going to get. I know it\'s tough people but there ARE good fantasy books out there (and certainly better writers) so show a little discretion and take a stand for quality. It\'s CERTAINLY not here.Recommended for people without any taste in fantasy or like it predictable and boring."
2879,0,Eragon: Don't waste your time on this one.: I fail to see how anyone with half a mind could find the book Eragon enjoyable. I found it a dull and uninteresting read with nothing I hadn't read in another fantasy book before. Just because the author started writing the book at fifteen is no excuse for his poor writing skills and unoriginal ideas. I warn people not to waste their time reading this book.
2880,0,"Nothing new, why the hype?: Story was okay, just not the best writing. Seemed like a typical fantasy with absolutely no surprises. There are a lot better fantasies out there--try the Book of Three or even Tamora Pierce before this..."
2881,0,"Stay Away: My recommendation for this book: stay away. My 12 year old son is a huge fantasy fan, so I bought this for him after hearing all the hype. He gave it back to me after reading about 100 pages and asked if it was too late to return it for our money back. I figured it couldn't be that bad, so I began reading iti myself. It is. This book is simply poorly written, horribly derivative of quite a few other fantasy titles (I used to read a lot of fantasy to my son when he was younger), and simply not a very good story. I'm glad so many other people seem to like it (although I'm stumped as to what they see in it). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone however."
2882,0,"Amazingly overrated: As I read this, I was constantly shocked by the complete lack of originality of the book. It is one thing to be influenced by great fantasy writers, quite another to unabashedly lift ideas from them, as Paolini does. Many of the people praising him do so because they are caught up in the hype of his being a 15-year-old writer. I suggest they read Anne McCaffrey's books to see what a whopping amount of her dragon lore he has borrowed. For the source of his treatment of elves and dwarves, look no further than JRR Tolkien.Bottom line - disappointing for someone who is familiar with his sources, and is evaluating the book on its merits as a work of fantasy, not as 'a-work-of-fantasy-written-by-a-fifteen-year-old'. It might be 'original' for someone who is not."
2883,0,"Eragon: My first thought was how close to Lord of the Rings this was. I did enjoy the concept of the story but thought it could have been more original. Eragon (Aragorn?) to close. It was as if I were reading a distortion of LOTR, Dragon Riders of Pern, and Star Wars. I will read Eldest because I adore Saphira. She was what kept me going through it all."
2884,0,"not the best book: This book was all very good to start with but then the main character, Eragon, and his dragon go out to kill someone. Thats not what i like. Near the end there is also a lot of fighting. I didnt like that so much. I will still read the second one to see if it gets any better..."
2885,0,"Wow: I recieved this book for Christmas after hearing a lot about it's 19 year old author. I originally thought wow, a nineteen yearold writing fantasy awesome, but then I started reading it. WOW this is a piece of crap. I'm going to assume that Chris has read a lot of fantasy, and because of this has been influenced by the books that he has read to the point that he is lacking any original thoughts at all. The only reason I'm giving this book two stars is because he is 19 and he needs props for getting a book published (even if his family oned the publishing company) when he is so young."
2886,0,"Ummmmm. . . . . Beautiful Jacket, I guess: Before I begin, I have to give a nod to the author who, after all, is only 19 years old. If any of my students wrote this well, I'd be very impressed. That said, I still don't think young Paolini is anywhere near ready for publishing, and I'm frankly a little confused as to both how and why this book was accepted and marketed so lavishly.The plot line is predictable, the diaglogue trite, and the writing style very clearly that of a beginner. I read to page 200, hoping and hoping that something would happen to justify the glowing reviews featured on the dust cover. Unfortunately, nothing did, and I just can't make myself go on. This book may interest very young teens (although in our post-Harry Potter world, perhaps not), but otherwise, I would caution against wasting either the money or the time."
2887,0,"Somewhat Lacking: The fact that this author is young does IS amazing, however the literary work is not so impressive. Yes, it is in-depth and has the normal twists and turns of fantasy books, but it lacks the craftsmanship of better writers. I believe this author has not yet acheived the ability to create 'atmosphere' liek many others have been able to. If you are interested in a hard-core fantasy series, Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' is a great one to start in. With over 9 books, its completely comprehensive; the first books being easy enought o read for all people, and the latter ones being rediculously awesome and complex. A must read."
2888,0,"Tolkien, this is not: With Eragon, Christopher Paolini has attempted to write the next great epic fantasy of our time. He\'s taken all the usual ingredients; dragons, elves, dwarves, evil spirits who can\'t bear daylight, a fantastical new world, a wise, mysterious guide, and a young boy with a mysterious heritage, and mashed them together into a 500+ page novel. But in the end, Eragon is like so many other Tolkien-esque epic fantasies: all epic, and no magic. The story dragged on, and even when I skimmed whole chapters I couldn\'t make myself sit all the way through it. I\'ve tried to read it twice now, and I\'ve given up both times.Paolini\'s prose and plot aren\'t rotten; they just failed to grab my attention. If you haven\'t read a lot of epic fantasy, you\'ll probably like this. But for those of us who have ... this is pretty much a ""been there, done that,"" kind of story. There is nothing new under the sun, but most authors can put a twist on the same old devices and make them seem new. Paolini didn\'t."
2889,0,"great effort!: Young Mr. Paolini has a bright future as a writer should he decide to take some formal instruction. While he is obviously blessed with a fertile imagination his prose are weak and descriptions need work. I am more surprised at a publisher such as Knopf for editing the work in this fashion and question whether this was a marketing experiment geared at young readers. Nonetheless, it should not be compared to the writing prowess of authors such as Rowlings or Dhal. It is just another episode of a Hercules-like adventure. A lot of fun, but I dare to see him study at college, then read him when he has a greater command of writing. Goodluck."
2890,0,okay: okay this book was... ok. I mean who likes a book that overly describes a freakin sunset and doesnt describe a action scene literally not at all? i mean come on. plus the writing wasnt as good as i was hoping it to be. i think christopher P. needed to wait a while and let his writng improve. the plot isnt that bad but the characters needed more depth. i dont recomend buying
2891,0,"If your ages 0-13 this might be a book for you: First up let me tell you something about myself, I enjoy every book from page start to end. No matter what the book it will always appeal to me. But when the book's over, and I think about it, thats when my actual opinion of the book comes out. The same holds true for Eragon. I loved every page of it. A day after I read it, it seemed like crap! The plot is that of every single fantasy book every written. I know there are small differences, like the fact he rides the dragon around, and that the dragon is a large part of the story, but other then that you could switch the main characters name to Frodo and you'd have Lord of the Rings. I'd suggest this book to anyone from the ages 0-13 it might appeal to you, with your small minds."
2892,0,"I agree with Ivy: Okay. This kid can write. True. But...the incessant versions of things other than said (assured was one that irked me severely) was aggravating. And the story was SOO cliched, it was incredible. I really could barely stand it. It was just a jumble of every fantasy story you\'ve ever read. And I don\'t think he ""was inspired by"" Tolkien. Get it right. He copied him."
2893,0,"A Confusing Mishmash: Although I do give the author credit for being so young and publishing what must have been quite an undertaking, the end result is still a confusing mishmash of a fantasy story clearly written by a writer before his time. The main character expresses himself in some very illogical ways. Example: He gets ""angry"" at the blue stone he finds when it wakes him up one night. (????) If a blue stone was rolling around your bedroom, would your first reaction be anger at REM interruption or general surprise and shock? The rest is more of the same, added to an assembly of skin-deep characters and a propensity for utter, recurring, consistent, on-going, verbose adjective addiction in describing even the simplest thing."
2894,0,"Eragon this, Eragon that, I don't see the point.: Don't get me wrong, I think its well written. And almost every modern fantasy writer draws on LOTR alot. But they have the advantage of doing it more...subtley.But even that might have been excusable if it had been a bit more interesting with a slight hint of unique style. I also agree with everyone else in that it was predicdtable. But the thing that really annoyed me? The fact that Eragon did not seem real. Even Brom seemed more realistic than the main character. And the way that Paolini kept on dropping BIG hints that Eragon was going to have this romantic love affair. That has really put me off the next book. And I wonder who the lover is going to be? A beautiful elf. My advice is to read Terry Prattchet instead who at least uses characters who seem stereo-typical but really are as unpredictable as you can get."
2895,0,"*sigh*: Don\'t bother wasting your time reading this book if you have conveniant access to either a copy of the ""Lord of the Rings"" or perhaps ""Dragonriders of Pern"". Not only does Paolini ""borrow"" characters, theme, and overall plot from both professional works, but he practically takes them and strangulates them into his own ""retooling"". This book is just plain awful and I honestly regret ever having shelled out the cash to purchase it."
2896,0,Terrible book: This book is horrible. Don't waste your money. I'd rather read a matchbook than this travesty. HOW did this get published? Is the vast majority of the fantasy fan reader-base REALLY that stupid that they'd give this steaming pile of offal 5 stars? I fear for our future as a nation.
2897,0,"Ack. It stinks: Sorry kiddies--this ain't a good book. I'm one of those people who usually can't help but finish a book I start, no matter how bad it is. I stopped reading this one. Enough said."
2898,0,"copy cat: I think the book is to much like the lord of the rings with descriptions of people and places and i dont think its orginal at all.Its the same by having the character vunrable at the begin not nowing there true strength eg.Frodo,eragon.And also Brom and Gandalf are the same sort of character.The Elves and the dwarfs have the same description as in lord of the ring and the languages and names are the same.Also the Razac are like the ringwraiths hissing and black hooded.He also talks about the Evles coming other on ships and living in a forest that no one apart from the evles have travelled in without not coming out,that is also the same.I could sit here all day and compare both stories so iam just going to say all in all a very poor reflection of a really good story by J.R Tolkein."
2899,0,"Childish: Don\'t be fooled by editors\' words of ""promising writer"", ""shows maturity"", "" a new talent discovered"", etc., etc., etc. This book was written by a kid, using kid\'s words, and its a childish book, very simplistic. Looked to me like it was written for a ""show and tell"" homework, and a very long one at that. I do not wonder the movie was a disaster: the base was very flimsy and with no ""meat"" to fill out a coherent story. This is a kindergarten story...for toddlers."
2900,0,"Can\'t Even Bare to read it.....>.<: This book is actually pretty bad.I still haven\'t finished it(I\'m on the part where Eragon is staying at Tronjeihm) because i can\'t bare to read it. It has waaaay too much dialogue and Paolini doesn\'t describe the setting or anything enough to picture it in your mind. I\'ve heard many excuses for this book actually being good. Today at school before I wrote this, I told my friend that i was writing a review on Eragon (he has read Eragon and Eldest and loved them). I told him that i hated the book and Paolini copied some names in the books. My friend said, ""Just because they sound almost the same, it doesn\'t mean he copied them."" Ok here\'s a little note to Matt(my friend): For one thing there were A LOT of names that Paolini copied. And second, don\'t you think it\'s KIND OF odd that they would sound almost exactly the same??? Ok, well I hope you\'ve enjoyed my FIRST book review. And a hint of advice: DON\'T GET THIS BOOK!!!"
2901,0,eragon: i dont want to give a long essay so if you want that then read some of the other one star reviews. theyre all very accurate. ill just point out the one problem that really popped iout at me.i feel like the author had one of those fourth grade english teachers who told you nevef to use the word said and he has held onto that advice very closely. he uses any word he can think of even if he doesnt know the definition. if he cant think of a word he uses stated. sometimes people shouldnt even be stating things when he uses the word stated.also i feel like he was writing with a thesaurus next tto him and every time he came accross a smal word he looked it up and used the biggest most complicsted option without even bothering to check the full definition.in short dont read this book.
2902,0,"IS It a 1st Edition?: This was to be a gift for my husband who loves the Paolini stories, but also wants hardcovers in 1st edition state. A 1st edition has several criteria to meet and my Amazon purchase did not meet these. A true 1st must not be a bookclub edition - it must be part of the first original hardcover printing, ideally it also has a dustjacket with the publisher\'s price not cut. The item I received was a ""1st Edition"" from a ""special"" printing, thus not a true collector\'s first edition. I returned the item, no problems, and ordered directly from an online book dealer."
2903,0,"Couldnt Get Into It: I bought the sample and just couldnt get into it. I felt as if the plot were too fast pacd. Eragon was here, and them he was there withim two sentanes. Didnt really enjoy it."
2904,0,"so much like another fantasy book nothing original: if this is for a child then it is ok. it is fun to read. but for an adult. the plot is too simple. remember jane austen wrote pride and prejudice at 16. and that was a much better book.if you are an adult, probably better off reading George RR martin's game of throne series. there is more plots and depth.Eragon is made to be a stupid boy in the book who likes comforting words. who prefers not to face reality. does that really reflect what a teenager thinks? It's been a long time since I was a teenager. but i like to hear the truth of a situation no matter how unpleasant.i give it a 2 star and probably would get a bit more as a children's book."
2905,0,"Don\'t bother: There are so many other books to read that are fantastic in scope. If you value great storytelling, I suggest reading other authors, such as Garth Nix. His books are so much better than this ""book,"" and like others before me, I wonder how this was published."
2906,0,"A First Draft--Needs Revision: The novel is ok, but I can't praise it for its originality or characters. The plot is often convenient, predictable, and obviously taken from other books. The ending does not satisfy the reader, and the lack of consistent character development becomes annoying as characters suddenly grow and then revert to earlier behaviors.I have to agree with everyone criticizing the book's writing style. I know the author is just beginning, but he needs several writing courses. His sentences lack variety and the book needs much more attention to editing.As a family published novel, the book is impressive; however, as a work in mainstream publication, the work suffers from a weak tone, bad grammar, and a standard plot."
2907,0,"Please Tell Me It Gets Better!: I\'ve not finished this book. I\'ve not finished the third chapter. I\'ve heard such great things about this book, one of my best friends went so far as to call it ""like the best book ever."" So far, I\'ve found it well written but intensely dull. I\'m willing to give it a second chance however, as long as it gets better. If its anything near as good as ""Abarat"" which I\'d consider the best fantasy book of my generation, than it\'s going to get a lot better from this point."
2908,0,"Trying not to claw my eyes out: How people could get through the first two paragraphs is beyond me. If I want to read badly written prose that badly, I\'ll go online and search for amateur writers\' forums. To be frank, most of those are better than this.""...and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords.""The point of CREATIVE writing is to do something that hasn\'t already been done by EVERY OTHER fantasy writer out there. At least, that\'s how it always struck me. Tolkien, Brooks, and McCaffrey have influenced a load of people, most likely each other as well, and that\'s exactly what makes this piece utterly uncreative. Even the NAMES are uncreative, for heaven\'s sake.No, this is not worth $$$. Save your hard-earned money for something useful. Like coffee."
2909,0,"This didn't even deserve one star: I read an excerpt from this book, and I could barely get passed the first paragraph! The writing is choppy, it's full of terrible cliches and is probably one of the worst works of literature I have ever read."
2910,0,"SLOPPY, BORING, and COPIED, OH MY!: Ok, let's get things straight, Paolini really needs to come up with his OWN story. This book is pretty much a cauldron of books thrown together. Not only that, but the descriptions and dialogue are so boring and predictable, you could fall asleep. The main character is also supposed to be bright, but he is surprisingly stupid, and it does not help the story. I am a MAJOR fan of Tolkien and the similarities between that book and Eragon, and Eldest are astounding. I mean, just looking at the map, Furnost, Melian, Hadarac Desert umm I wonder where he got that from? LETS SEE!FORNOST, MELIAN THE MAIA, and HARAD!!! Its apalling at what this guy has written. SOOOO many similarities, it should really should not even receive a 1. Maybe some ignorent teens or adults and even little kids may like this, but if ur a hardcore fan of most medieval fantasies, don't even bother...-Lord Iluvatar Ambarenya Earendil"
2911,0,Completely wrong: I read a previous review that said 1-star reviewers were grumbling about it being a copy of other work. I can only wonder if this person actually read the reviews. Only a few people are grumbling about that aspect of this book. The vast majority recognize Eragon for what it is: the worst book ever written. From poor plotting to horrible story telling to stupid characters this book has it all. BORING doesn't even begin to describe it.
2912,0,"I'm so embarrassed: Before you read all the glowing reviews and buy this book, be warned: This is the start of the worst series ever printed. Not just because the author has discovered he has a virtual cash machine by claiming he wrote it when 15 or that he's milking it for every last penny it's worth but because bottom line, he doesn't write well enough to be printed in the sunday comics.How much of this do you think anyone can take? Stupid me I bought both books. I felt obligated to read them because I paid too much for the books to quit? I feel so embarrassed because I've been gushing about the books even though I never read them."
2913,0,"Cookie Cutter Fantasy Story All The Way: Save your money and buy Harry Potter. This is a cookie cutter fantasy story all the way, offering nothing new to the genre except triteness. Bland characters, bland story--he may know how to write but this is just SO PREDICTABLE AND it borrws so heavily from Tolkien and McCaffery that is really should not have been published. Awful! Zero stars!"
2914,0,"A grave dissapointment...: I was very much looking forward to reading this book but found it a grave dissapointment. I agree with many points made by the other reviewers who were not pleased with Eragon. I might add to those comments that JK Rowling is a good example of an author who, although extremely derivative of all fantasy novels which came before her, weaved these old ideas in a new and fresh and fun way. The characters in Eragon are stock and do not exhibit realistic development. Rather they simply fit right into new and fantastic roles given to them with the greatest of ease (ie: Eragon changing from farm boy to magic-wielding dragon rider in what seems like no time at all). I believe that Mr. Paolino could one day be a very good writer, but he needs to look at the mistakes made, both creatively and dramatically, in this first endeavour."
2915,0,"Borrow, don't buy: No sense buying this book. Plenty of copies of this are sitting gathering dust where kids like mine left them to rot. If you are reading this horrid book hoping it gets better in Eldest let me save the trouble by stating emphatically it doesn't."
2916,0,"Horrifyingly Bad: As a teenaged writer myself, I picked up Eragon after reading on the inside flap that the author started writing it at 15. However, I was severely disappointed when I started reading the book. Sure, the cover's attractive, and sure, the author was a teenager when he wrote it -- the book seems to have become a bestseller on those two factors alone, because it definitely wasn't literary merit that's caused it to sell so well.I anticipated Murtagh's little secret from the moment he was introduced, I found the main character to be bland and boring, and the story was hackneyed and ripped from other writers. I recommend fantasy fans read works by far more talented authors such as Holly Lisle, JK Rowling, and Eoin Colfer."
2917,0,"um... no.: I hated this book. People seem to give Paolini credit because he was a kid when he wrote it. But, he goes up and actually COMPARES his book to the greatness of other fantasy books like Beowulf and LOTR. If he wants to compare his book to books written by competent authors, his readers should grade Eragon with the same strictness. If Tolkien had written this, what would the reviews be? Much lower. The lack of originality and the obviously copied plot really take away from the actual book.I think my eyes were lacerated and bleeding after reading this trash."
2918,0,"Read the real thing instead.: This book is distressing in the amount of attention it is getting, when from the very first page it is apparent that the author ""borrowed"" massive amounts of detail, motifs, characters, names,languages, etc. from other fantasy writers, especially Tolkien. There was not an original phrase to be found. I was willing to give the book a try and was sorely disappointed. The publishers should be ashamed of themselves as they clearly chose this book as a marketing gimmick because of the author\'s age and have indeed made a fortune because of this."
2919,0,copycat: While the story kept me turning pages I kept feeling as if I where reading a poor reproduction of Robert Jordan's THE WHEEL OF TIME. Similarities range from the shape of the land on the map to the capabilities of the main character. Too many typical fantasy words crammed into every sentence give the impression of a high school writer getting carried away on a free writing exercise. Nothing special here other than the authors age...and it shows.
2920,0,"The greatest fantasy RIPOFF OF ALL-TIME!: Experience real fantasy and talent and pick up Tolkien, Rowling, Lewis, or even Jordan.Psst! If you want a really good reason why this book needs to be shamed, watch Star Wars: A New Hope and toss in a few Fellowship ripoffs too, and you will see Mr. Paolini's entire plot structure and even devices:Voila! You get Aragorn....er Eragon. The greatest fantasy RIPOFF OF ALL-TIME!But hey, the masses don't know the difference (heck they love it) and Mr. Paolini is laughing all the way to the bank."
2921,0,"chris paolini is a gomer!!!!!!!: i just finished this book, and all i can say was that itsucked. Chris Paolini is a gomer who thinks he can write well.URKELS!!!!!! i mean, come on. that sounds like some gomer d\'n\'dcrap. ""you hath been hit by an urkel. - 15 hp."" and all thatstuff about ""dragons and elves"" was retarded. if you want agood read, read a REAL fantasy book,(lord of the rings, harrypotter) and don\'t waste precious moments of your life readingthis sorry piece of useless crap."
2922,0,"Amateurish attempt at fantasy: Everything from word diction to language stylistic choices, to plot and character development betray that this is a work of an amateur writer. Everything was painfully predictable, or unrealistic, or outright boring. It's a pity since the author has good ideas. He just needs to learn how to write a story."
2923,0,"Yoda is in the next book . . .: Describe a rainstorm in 700 words or more, then continue like this for and entire novel. . .I would suggest that anyone considering reading this book just get the original or go rent the movie, it's called Star Wars. This novel followed that plot so closely that I checked the acknowlegements to see if it was intentional. I was shocked to see no mention of it at all. I was not shocked to find out Paolini's parents first published his work."
2924,0,"This book stinks: All Paolini did was take characters, events and ideas from Tolkien, McCaffery and many other major fantasy writers (thank goodness he didn't get his hands on Cooper), throw them in the blender and spit them out through his own playdo mold. The story smells like he's sprayed the whole thing with Tolkien perfume. All that would be acceptable if the kid could write. Being 18 years old myself, i am in a position to criticize. He doesn't go deeper than the surface on any of his characters or invesitgate their motives from more than one angle. His entire writing style is flat and childish. The words themselves are not intersting to read. As Stephen King said, they call is prose for a reason. People need to stop praising him just becuase he is a nineteen year old. Get real. This book stinks!"
2925,0,"He needs an editor . . .: . . . not a thesaurus. In the first few pages, I wanted to duck to avoid uninteresting flying adjectives. And you can\'t use the word ""stuff"" in a fantasy novel. And fantasy characters get sick. They do not throw up.I\'m excited about the fact that this book was written by a teenager, but I don\'t think we should ignore the rules of style and usage (and plot) just because he\'s 19. There are some mature ideas in the book (e.g., Eragon\'s discovery of his own mortality), and some of the passages obviously thought-out (good description of a battle scene -- not easy to do), but the characters\'actions are inexplicable (people show up in places with no explanation of why they are there; characters express strong emotions or sarcasm that has no connection to the content of a conversation) and the language is . . . what a 15 year old thinks a fantasy character would say. In general, the writing is distractingly unsophisticated."
2926,0,"Nothing New: Borrows HEAVILY from other fantasy novels, most notably the Pern series by Anne McCaffrey. Nothing original, but still entertaining. I enjoyed the book, but I don't feel it deserves all the credit and publicity it has been getting."
2927,0,"Good freshman start: This is a good book for a first attempt. I enjoyed the overall story and hope the other books get better. Nothing is really original, but it was a nice spin on the arch-types. Chris uses a LOT of flowery language, but if you look at his website that appears to be the way he talks. I was mentally distressed at his description of the village ravaged by Urgals near the beginning involving a spear in a heap. When you read it, be prepared! The battle scene in the end is a bit silly, the ""dragon armor"" doesn\'t make much sense and the ending is abrupt. It is clear that he wanted this to be a much longer story, but cut it short and turned it into a trilogy. Or maybe for the economic reasons, he envisioned it as a trilogy from the beginning. In any case, the book does not live up to the hype and do not believe for a second it is in the same class as Harry Potter."
2928,0,"Hear Ye! Hear Ye! This Book has Copied Star Wars: I am for one an avid writter about dragons myself but when I got Eragon at the bookstore and took it home I was almost puking from reading it, my eyeballs hurt so bad they almost melted out of my head. This book clearly copies the beginning plots to the movie Star Wars character by character, heres an example.Eragon/Luke SkywalkerBrom/Obi WanEragons Sword (was his fathers sword) Lukes Lightsaber (his fathers lightsaber)Eragon lives on a farm/Luke lives on a farmEragons Farm Burns/Lukes farm burns (attacked)Eragon saves this elf princess. LUKE SAVES PRINCESS LEIA!In my opinion the book is nothing more than a rip-off of what came before it, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Sorry Paoloni whatever your name is.....but I do not enjoy people whom copy others ideas in such a detailed way as yours."
2929,0,"Why all the hype?: I read ""Eragon"" as part of my own market research as a writer of teen fiction, and fail to see why it is getting praise. It\'s a far cry from unique, set in a fantasy world like most others. While I was interested enough to find out what happens next, the plot was never really remarkable. Plot ""twists"" are encountered with a slight nod. The psychology behind the characters is loose and some developments are sketchy (a woman on one side of the world conveniently appears on the other side of the world, and got there before Eragon, though it took him a week). And the ending...wait...that\'s the ending? I am reminded of my early efforts with managing long plots. I had the beginnings down, but the ends rushed to an impatient resolution. I think this book is 90% hype, and I\'m not impressed that he started writing when he was 15. So did I, and while my 500-pages of amateur effort commit many of the same sins as Paolini\'s published work, it\'s a better read, and unpublished (thank god!)."
2930,0,"Sorry, but I couldn\'t turn off my intelligence...: ...because according to some reviewers, that\'s what I need to do to enjoy Eragon. Stop overanalyzing and enjoy the story, right? I could do that if the poor writing weren\'t so obvious. That way, I wouldn\'t be distracted by thinking ""oh, that\'s so cliche"" or ""that\'s really predictable"" or ""every character talks and acts the same way"". To be a good book, you need an interesting story AND decent writing. Eragon barely succeeds at the former, and completely fails at the latter."
2931,0,"Master Paolini? I think not.: I have recently read some reviews by five star people in response to one star people. They make their case. He is fifteen, say the one star people. They say, Give him a break. After reading this, I have my own views on the matter. First, I admit it is very good for a teen writer. However, it is not good for a published work of fiction. I would accomadate for his flaws and agree with the five star people had he not said on his site, ""I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney\'s translation of Beowulf."" Obviously, the publicity of this book has bloated his ego, because his writing is nowhere near that of the aformentioned authors. I can only hope that you will not fuel his vanity and purchase a copy of Eragon."
2932,0,"The most unoriginal piece of crap I have ever read.: Don't waste your time. As predictable and trite as most fantasy is nowadays, Eragon is the epitome of it. It has every fantasy cliche in existence and contains absolute NO original material whatsoever. It is a frankenstein of a book, with an arm from Tokien and a torso from Goodkind. All he did was tape it all together. If you've read ANY fantasy book before, you know exactly what will happen, just replace the names with other ones. Its the most unoriginal piece of crap I have ever seen. The only reason it was published was because his parents owned a publishing company and having a kid author is a great marketing angle. If anybody else had written that book, they would have been laughed into the street."
2933,0,"AS ORIGINAL AS HELEN KELLER JOKES: Eragon isn't so much an original novel as a compilation of bad fantasy cliches. The author has somehow managed to incorporate every single one of these into the space of a mere few hundred pages, from placing apostraphes in the middle of proper nouns (how exotic!!) to big firebreathing dragons, swords with MAGICAL DARK POWERS, and zombies bent on killing everything that moves. And this ugly amalgam is laudable because the author is 18? Give me a break. To make an analogy, if you took Brad Pitt's face, gave it Johnny Depp's ears, added Jackie Chan's chin, and finally appended Denzel Washington's nose, would the result be worth looking at?The only thing more depressing than this book is the fact that so many people imbibe this garbage with such voraciousness - indeed, at the time that I visit this page, Eragon is 279th on the Amazon.com sales list. Sad."
2934,0,"The Essence of Premature Publishing- a review of Eragon: The first thing I want to say about this book is that the cover is absolutely stunning- no, really, look at it: There is Sapphira the dragon and her awesome azure eye, beckoning to all fans of Tolkien, of fantasy...of 497-page-long novels...they're in for a nasty shock. Cliches! Useless descriptions of /lamps/! An 'ancient language' that sounds like a dying furby! A main character who is meant to be talented, kind, and courageous, but is portrayed as stupid, sentimental and ridiculously talented at everything-swordfighting, reading, magic-he attempts! Robbery of ideas from Tokien, McCaffrey and Lucas!Haste makes waste, Paolini! Wait a few more years before asking Mom and Dad to publish your crap![...]"
2935,0,Been there--done that: Not a bit of this book is original. I can't tell you how dissapointed I was to read it after hearing all the hype. It is simply no good. Maybe he'll grow up a bit and the sequel will be better (and not a rip off of every other fantasy novel ever written)
2936,0,"I-Be-Gone: My 14-year old niece didn\'t care for this book and I should have listened to her before buying it. I\'m halfway through the story and have already lost interest. This is just my opinion and I don\'t mean to be harsh, but I feel that if I were to take transcripts of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" and shuffle them both together, I\'d get ""Eragon"". I do believe that with proper schooling, this young author will have a bright career and I hope he\'ll consider a re-write of this novel. I\'m sure that I would have enjoyed this attempt more if the characters spoke in traditional old-english OR new-modern dialect, as I found that blending the speaking styles was distracting. I also would have preferred less repetitive conversation and more action. The first 2 chapters were good, but after that became tedious. So, I think that the book is too wordy for kids under the age of 13 and not sophisticated enough for those who are older. Sorry."
2937,0,"Not worth it. Why did I bother?: I have not read the Lord of the Rings and many other popular fantasies, but even so I could just feel it in my bones that his book was one big fat cliche. While reading it I was thinking to myself, ""Why don\'t I like it, why don\'t I like it?"" and after doing a bit of research I found out why. Sure, I\'ll admit it had some exciting parts in it, sort of, but overall I do not beleive this is anything special. I had about a quarter of the book left before I finally couldn\'t take the torture anymore and just returned it to the library."
2938,0,"Pathetic!: I read 2 books a week, less when I have school, but this book is pathetic. Absolutely the worst I've ever encountered. Moronic characters and horrible. Skip it!"
2939,0,"Q&A Storytelling: Finally finished ""the dragon book"" as my friend keeps calling it and, looking back, I cannot believe I made it all the way through.Nothing surprising happened from start to finish, plot and character entirely predictable.Characters are uniformly Good or Evil in uniformly dull ways.Every chapter is written like a Q&A.; Eragon endlessly asking questions and getting answers. The author cannot stage a dramatic exchange of dialog.Gah."
2940,0,"holy crap: This is one of the worst books i have ever read. I know the author is young(i'm still younger than him tho, but my god, the writing in this novel is disgusting. I almost threw up reading it, i seriously did. Maybe it's just because i'm used to the writings of Tolkien and George R.R. Martin, but this guy really needs to learn how to write. Hopefully he'll get better and at least become as competant as Robert Jordan, but that still isn't anything to brag about."
2941,0,NO NO NO: Eragon is the worse book I ever read. It just a stupid awful book with no point. Read anything else!!!!!!
2942,0,"unoriginal: Hmm, this is going to be a short review because there really isn't much to say and everyone else has already said it. If you want a more childish adventurous fantasy book then this is great. Its got all the archetypical plotlines, characters, magics, and creatures you could ever want. It just has a story that is fun to read, nothing more and therefore it gets no more than two stars. I can't believe at how popular this is and that it already has a movie, kinda sad. To unoriginal. . ."
2943,0,"Derivative, but a fun read anyway: ""Derivative"" is an understatement. Almost every element of this book was taken from someplace else. The setting is Middle Earth, even down to the different varieties of orc (err...urgal). The description of magic is from Earthsea. Much of the plot is Star Wars, from the destruction of Luke\'s uncle\'s farm to the apprenticeship with Obi-wan (err....Brom), but then reverts to Middle Earth (the seige of Gondor and the killing of the Lord of the Nazgul) at the end. And of course, the dragons and dragon-riders are straight from Pern.The descriptions are unbelievably overdone, from the ""it was a dark and stormy night"" school of literature.But despite all these faults, it was a fun read! My kids loved it, and I picked it up on a day that I was home sick and couldn\'t put it down. I got to know and like the characters, and I\'m looking forward to reading Book 2."
2944,0,"Throughly Disapointing: While the first chapter clearly showed possibility, the rest of the book seems rushed - as if, having got his great idea, he didn't know where to go with it and shuffled together bits of every great fantasy book ever written. The title, even, is vertually indistinguishable from Aragorn of Lord of the Rings fame.Perhaps, if he'd spent more time thinking and ploting out the book, it would've been beter. Until that rewrite, however, avid readers of the genre should stick away for fear of disapointment."
2945,0,"HI!: Lessee here, there's a big blue book. *read read read* Hmm, it has star wars, lotr, and even Dragon's Blood rip-offs!!!! Saphira is like an awful version of Heart's Blood.Do not read this book!"

2947,0,"Been done before.: Don't bother to buy this book. Chances are if you like fantasy literature you've already read this book--under a different title, written by a different author. Save your money."
2948,0,"copycat: I read the first chapter and was not impressed. I think he copied J.R.R. Tolkien. Instead of orcs, he has Urgals. He even copied Arwen! The magic is too easy to cast and it works every time. The languages are inconsistent and sound like a caveman trying to talk. You should read Tolkien's books. They are waaaaaaay better."
2949,0,"Meh.: If you've read any fantasy at all, this book will put you to sleep. Imagine all the big stories in the genre combined into one book without a bit of the craft or individual voice that sets a good, if average, fantasy novel apart."
2950,0,"Barely Readable: Quickly reviewed: the story is derivative, the characters are under-developed and the dialogue is wooden. Overall not a very enjoyable read but a younger reader (early teens?) may find some merit."
2951,0,"What utter drek.: I was excited to read this book, what with all of the praise I had heard for the 17-year-old that had written. How disappointed was I. This is, without an ounce of doubt, the most poorly written book I have ever regrettably paid money for. Shoddy characters, a splotchy story, and an over all plot that seems to pull from other fantasy writers that are much, much better than he is. Honestly, I cannot believe how many mistakes he made while writing his story. I just wanted to take a red pen and scribble out whole pieces of useless details.If you want to read an adolescent fantasy novel, go read The Golden Compass, or a Wrinkle in Time. Don't even bother touching trash like this."
2952,0,"Been there, done that: I picked this book up and half way through it felt like I had read it before. After I found out it was written by a teenager I was no longer suprised by the poor dialogue. It felt very predicatable based on books I have already read. It was like Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. I wont bother with the second book."
2953,0,Stolen material all the way through: This whole book is nothing but a rip off of some of the best fantasy writers out there. It's a Starwars/LOTR/Belgarion/Elenium/Dragon Riders/ and about 15 others copy. Not only that but the texts itself is so poorly worded and done I barely made it throught the first chapter. The only reason I finished this book was so I could find out just how much stolen material this book contains. Well...I'm surprised it got published at all considering how poorly its written and how much of the context is ripped off other authors.
2954,0,"Not bad but copied, and predictable story: When i firstly glanced over the book I've already checked out it will be a Lord of the Rings copy. The map with the semi-known names, the language of the dwarves, etc. Then I started to read. The story itself was intresting (I like fantasy so I like this kind of story...), but usually very plain and predictable. Who hadn't know that Eragon will go for a long and lifechanging journey, he will save the elf and fall in love into her slowly, Brom is well-known in the far lands, Murtagh is the son of a great evil Rider, etc.Maybe if Paolini would create some own thing, he could be good writer...Now he remains fine fan-fiction writer, they use to write copies."
2955,0,"arrrgh: Avoid this book. It is one of the worst written fantasy books I have every read. I commented to a friend after reading it that he should avoid it as it reads like it was written by a teenage kid, only then did I find out that it actually was. This book did not deserve my hard earned money and I am annoyed at all the praise it received which seems more aimed at the authors age than the actually quality of the book. I didn't get a discount for his age so he should not be getting kind praise for this trash merely for his age."
2956,0,"Awful. TRULY terrible.: Are all you people giving this book a five star review drunk, 11 years old or just stupid? This books is terrible. It's a cookie-cutter rehash of about a trillion other pulp fantasy novels that have been written over the last 20 years, and it's not even a very good one. Half the reviews I see trumpet how this was written by a teenager---I'd argue that's blindingly obvious, and perhaps the publisher should have kept that under wraps. This books is a disgrace. I wouldn't wipe my @$$ with it...All you kiddies writing in with 5 star reviews should go back to your D+D and Magic games and leave book reviewing to people who can actually drive cars. Pathetic."
2957,0,"An awful, awful book: This is probably the worst book I have ever read. It left me lukewarm towards the characters, not really caring whether they lived or died. The plot was slow and predictable, with parts taken almost directly from other popular pieces of liturature. The writing was atrocious. I could not even finish this book, that's how bad it was. I can not imagine why anyone would like this. Sorely disapointed."
2958,0,Terrible: I Couldn't even get past page 60. This is just a copy of other fantasy books. A place called Gilead: Dark tower??? Author must get his own ideas

2961,0,Plagiarism!: It's really too bad that Paolini had to BLATANTLY STEAL his ideas from other books and games. This book is nothing but a pile of stolen junk.

2963,0,"Ewww I dont even have to read it: I wish he came up with better ideas, too much like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. I understand taking elements, but taking the same entire story is pretty terrible and another thing. This book is like taking a paper bag, and turning it inside out, it appears different, still a paperbag, but what they have in common is that you can wipe your ass with them. :-)"
2964,0,"Not memorable for many adult readers: Christopher Paolini did an amazing job to write this book at the age of 17. However, the imagination and originality of Eragon is lacking. It seems as if the plot is derived from a mixture of a number of past fantasy novels. Overall, the plot contains trite ideas and themes. Character development, and especially emotional development, are areas that are weak. It is a fairly good book, especially for younger readers, but there is not much substance and originality to make it memorable for older readers."
2965,0,"Agreeing with B. Capossere's review ...: I agree with B. Capossere's lengthy and thoughtful review. This was a 17-year-old fantasy book written by a 17-year-old. My 12-year-old son loved it, and that is to be expected. But where was Paolini's editor? For my part, I felt like the work jerked me back-and-forth, as the author would run deep for a bit, then shallow, then back and forth. While I enjoyed the story as a reflection -- as Capossere points out -- of greater fantasy writers, with some tighter editing, this could have been even better.Still, hurrah for Paolini for self-publishing and believing in his work enough to see it through! I'll look forward to reading his works in 10 years or so ...."
2966,0,"hard to understand: I\'m a very good reader. I read the fifth Harry Potter book in two days (like 900+ pages). This book took me about a month to read B/C it had a lot of unnecessary detail and probably could have been written much better in about 300 pages. I\'m not surprised that lots of other kids like this book, it was sorta fun and exciting (key word: sorta). The other main reason I didn\'t enjoy this book was because so much of it was copied from LOTR, which I read also. I don\'t think Christopher Paolini meant to copy certain parts of the book, but that\'s not really much of an excuse. There\'s too much plagarism for it to have been ""Subconsious""DON\'T READ UNLESS YOU\'RE A FANTASY FANATIC AND DON\'T CARE ABOUT PLAGARISM OR ARE LESS THAN 13 YEARS OLD!!!!!!!"
2967,0,"Paolipini Rocks!: Christopher Pailioni is amazingly gifted writer, reading Paolumini story takes you away to world full of magical magic things and twinkly glitery stuff. It's incredible. Its really cool to see such a young guy like Paompelini make such a wonderful book, Plumpuli should get an award. As for those claims that Paelimei copied Lord of the Rings, fooey! Those movies came out after Poalinis wrote his storybook. Id give Palolina 5 stars but he forgot one thing, the mostest important thing for a childrens book, pictures!"
2968,0,"Ah, youth.: Amazing? The best book ever? Incredibble [sic] writing? Ahhh...to be young and stupid again! These youngsters will probably be ashamed to remember their bright-eyed, glowing praise for what is not even a sub-par fantasy knockoff when they get older and discover real fantasy. I read this to my kid. I was ashamed to have finished the book, even in that capacity. He lost interest about 1/2 way through--I lost it much earlier. I guess you can\'t blame the kids for their poor taste. I listened to the Monkees when I was younger ;-) Consider ""Eragon"" the Monkees of fantasy novels....it looks pretty but their isn\'t much there when you actually stop and pay attention to it."
2969,0,"not bad, not great: Alas, having been steeped in Tolkien and CS Lewis, I have extremely high standards. This book is not bad, and kudos for the author being so young, but I was not personally thrilled. I shall read the sequel but I went ahead and gave ""Eregon"" away."
2970,0,"PLEASE FIND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL!!!!!!!: Please find this review helpful! Nobody ever finds my reviews helpful! It\'s awful, I try my best and people don\'t like them. It\'s not that hard, really! Just mark ""yes"" under ""was the review helpful to you."" Pleeeeeeeease do it. It would really make me happy. Nobody EVER finds my reviews helpful!I had to repost this review because Amazon deleted it before."
2971,0,"To put it more succinctly.....: There is nothing innovative in this book. What was innovative of Tolkien, LeGuin, and Mcaffrey has been regurgitated in Eragon. It is remarkably well done for a teenager's mimicry of greater works, but will remain just that. Mimicry. Two stars instead of one because it was readable."
2972,0,"does NOT own his own company!: Look, I don\'t really like Eragon, but I would like to clear some thing up. A lot of reviewers have dissed Paolini becuase supposedly his parents ""owned their own publishing company."" Well that is FALSE. His parents self published some books of their own, and they helped him self publish Eragon, but the key here is SELF-PUBLISHED. While I don\'t personally like the book (too cliche for me) I have to give him a hand for how he marketed it. Paolini did it the good old American way by publishing the book himself and then fighting tooth and nail to get people to buy it, by traveling the country, giving his own lectures in libraries and schools, and trying to sell it himself in bookstores. To make a long story short, he worked hard to get Eragon picked up by a traditional publishing company, so whether you liked the book or not, stop giving him a hard time for something that is not accurate."
2973,0,"Am I expecting too much? Nope, not at all: Cliche, ripoff, no use of the word said, it's all been said why this book is crap.All right, there's lots of cliched pulp fantasy out there, but at least these mediocre books accept what they are. If you'll check out Paolini's website, you'll see the arrogance he's developed from writing a mediocre pulp fantasy book that thinks it's going to be a classic."
2974,0,"Ergaon...uh oh: Christoper Paolini graduated from high school at the age of 15 and in my opinion he should have waited a good deal longer to write Eragon. See, Eragon is not that bad of a idea just poorly executed. The writing falls flat on all facets and in my opinion cant compete with the likes of Robert Jordan, CS Lewis, and even JK Rowling. Considering how many people dislike his book I would not be suprised to find his next book, Eldest to be a real jaw dropper. Critiscm only makes you stronger and Paolini is gonna need alot of it to succeed in this biz. All told Eragon is Poor, unorginal with flat bordering on boring writing. If your new to the genre or 14 and younger I could reccomend it (but I wont). Bottom Line: Wait and see how Eldest is before you try Eragon."
2975,0,"Cliche: The plot of this book is the classic coming-of-age story (with dragons, albeit) that one sees in works such as Harry Potter and Star Wars. You can basically cross out the character names from synopses of those and replace them with the character names from Eragon. The story line is classic, but this book doesn't even bring any interesting twists to it.The characters are archetypes, with no personality quirks that would have made them actually interesting.If the author was given an assignment to write a book based on this classic story type, this would have been an admirable response. As it is, it's mind-numbingly boring. It's amazing for a book written by a fifteen-year-old, but it's still not very interesting."
2976,0,"Long winded any one: When I was a little kid, I started and read this book, and I found it quite good, then I read decent fantasy novels. This book is so immensity long winded that if you cut it down to important details, it would have been maybe thirty pages. In addition to having a paper thin plot that anyone could guess the ""twists"" the author blatantly rips off other authors and works as opposed to creating his own ideas. The ancient language is Latin and dwarves speak german! Urgales are simply orcs. All of the characters are shallow and make nothing but one terrible decision after another. Also, the magic users in this book are super weak and whinny ""oh, I can\'t heal him easily, it a paper cut, better draw on my magic reserves!"" seriously, this book is nearly as bad as Harry Potter. Don\'t waste your time on this book if you can read above a third grade level."
2977,0,"Not as good as Harry Potter: I love Harry Potter Books and a lot more other teen novels such as the Bronze Bow. However, this book is very dull and I agree with others who say it is a rip off from other novels. I have read five chapters and I am, not sure if I want to go on. This was said to be as good as harry potter but I think it is very poor work."
2978,0,"Disappointing: I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews on Amazon. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book."
2979,0,"Um... wow: How to make Eragon:Get the plot/characters/style from a bunch of brilliant books and moviesSeparate the good things from the badDispose of all the good qualitiesMix all that's left (aka crap) in a panThrow in some ridiculous-sounding made-up wordsAdd LOTS of plot holes (a HUGE empire that controls a whole continent can't catch a kid with an overgrown, annoying lizard?)Heat at 350 degress for three hours or until everything remotely decent has drained awayPublishCongrats! You've made Eragon!(I really did want to like Eragon... but my friends can write MUCH better things than this monstrosity in twenty minutes!)"
2980,0,"Booo...: This book and its author bothers me for the following reasons:1) Just because he wrote this when he 15 does NOT automatically make this a great book2) For the record, it ISN'T a great book.3) The story is derivative4) Of Tolkien5) And God knows how many other fantasy novels6) It's sappy7) It's unengaging8) You can tell it was written by a 15-year-old9) The Editing is horrible! (Who edited this? Oh right...HIS PARENTS)10) Frankly, I think it's a waste of paperOn the other hand, the title page art is lovely."
2981,0,"Not another one (groan): Not another ""this is a children\'s book, so don\'t criticize it"" reviewer. Wendelin Van Fan, here\'s some stuff for you.Wendelin said that criticizing Eragon is like ""13 year olds criticizing Berenstein Bears."" First off, how do you know the ages of the reviewers? Many of them are in fact ""young adults"". I\'m sixteen and I know a crappy, cliched book when I see it.Second, Paolini obviously didn\'t mean for Eragon to be as immature as you think it is. His own website shows his pretentiousness in quotes like ""I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney\'s translation of Beowulf."" He\'s comparing his own work to established classics, so why shouldn\'t we do the same? Face it. Eragon\'s not a decent children\'s book. It\'s a poorly written adult book and anyone, no matter how old he or she is, has the right to criticize it."
2982,0,"Disappointing: You can tell this book was written by a kid. I've found it very dull reading, and can't imagine why it's sold so many copies. Maybe it's the novelty of it having been written by a home-schooled kid, because it certainly isn't the gripping narrative. Nothing happens in this book for pages and pages. And the emotions that Eragon expresses; well, as I said, you can tell it was written by a kid because there's just no sophistication to the language or story telling. You'd be better off reading the Artemis Fowl series (fun and funny), of if you're older, the His Dark Materials series (sophisticated and thoughtprovoking)."
2983,0,"not very good: Christopher is trying to create an elabrate world of destiny, magic, and dragons, the cover and introduction looked cool but the text was the corniest thing ever! cornier than any sitcom i've ever seen!!! i mean it had unneccasary chapters and stupid magic, no offense chris i appreciate the effort. If you (reader) think it looks good read it: opinions are like armpits everyone has and they all stink"
2984,0,"Stick to Harry Potter: Want original fantasy that is interesting, new, and fun to read? Steer clear of this book. I suggest Terry Brooks\' original ""Sword of Shanarra"" series. It is not high fantasy but it\'s better than this rip-off. Ech. I had to take a shower once I finally finished it. Boy am I glad I borrowed and did not buy this stinker!!"
2985,0,"Familiar characters: One word best describes this book: Derivative. The author didn\'t have to do very much description of his fantasy world because all the players were ""borrowed"" from other authors\' worlds --- especially Tolkien\'s. Paolini didn\'t have to explain the relationship between elves & humans & dwarves, since Tolkien fans already know all that. Fine; it\'s fan-fiction. But I was very disappointed that Paolini didn\'t give Tolkien a mention in his Acknowledgements section.Paolini even tried to mimic LotR by including some ""translated"" elvish poetry. That was by far the most embarrassing part of this book. Prose was stilted (really needed some professional editing), but the poetry was just . . . awful. Glad it was only attempted once.Despite the book\'s flaws, I did enjoy the story line, and did read the book all the way through. I may even borrow a copy of ""The Eldest"" when it comes out. But I would not pay money for it."
2986,0,"Laughable: Having read an excerpt of this travesty I must say that, while having the patience to write a book at 17 is admirable,it does not mean that said book is worth publishing and this patently isn\'t.Painfully derivative and crammed with embarrasingly clumsy phraseology,I can only hope that Mr Paolini looks back on this in 30 years and thinks ""Dear god, I am the luckiest man on god\'s green earth, that this rubbish sold so well."""
2987,0,"Good enough for light reading...plot was copied: I enjoyed the book as a good lite read. When I got to the end, I realized that all the major plot elements were stolen from Star Wars. I hated the book from that point on. Paolini tends to randomly use obscure and superfluous words. Not a good technique."
2988,0,"Why do so many people love this book?: I don\'t mean to insult the fans of Eragon, but I can\'t see why other teenagers find this book so amazing. After reading the first page, one can guess immediately that it was not written by an adult. Some may argue that it\'s very good for the writing of a teenager, but I must disagree. Every idea is a cliche. Every creature is noticeably familiar. Every event is predictable. The character development, though present, seemed very forced, as did most other aspects of the novel. I quickly became weary of the overdone descriptions and awkward dialogue and phrases. The standard elementary school rules of ""show, don\'t tell"" are violated all too often. Worst of all, Mr. Paolini didn\'t make me ""care"" about the characters, so the plot itself was worthless to me. Even as an avid reader, I honestly had to push myself to finish reading this. I advise you to save yourself the time and boredom--don\'t bother reading this book."
2989,0,"His age is no excuse...: To be honest, criticisms of this book have already been voiced a hundred times before, and better than I could say. Derivative, unashamedly cliched and dull...sadly, it's all true. But one thing that keeps popping is the author's age. The fact is that blaming the poor quality of the writing on his youth is a bit of a cop out. If you can write well, you can write well no matter how old you are. Sure, you improve as you go along, but a novice writer who starts at the age of 30 can be just as bad as a novice who starts at 13. Don't give this kid the excuse; talent shows at any age, and he has very little."
2990,0,"Please, make it stop!: A friend gave this book to me with the advice that it was the best book she had ever read. With that in mind, I began reading yesterday.I doubt I will be able to finish it, though I have given it the great attempt.The plot is derivative, the characters have major mood swings and little continuity of characterization. The emotions are over the top - screaming because of minor slights, then back to normal within the same paragraph. The overuse of adjectives and descriptive tags is annoying.Sigh.Yes, it's impressive that a teenager wrote a large tome. It shouldn't have been published without major editing. I suppose the plot can be overlooked as there are worse ones out there but the writing itself, while technically and gramattically correct is ponderous and frankly boring.Reading should not be a chore."
2991,0,"well... maybe for kids...: While kids might like this story, the writing is shabby at best and really lacks any kind of skill with the language. Don't expect any material that Anne McCaffery and a thousand others haven't already slaughtered into meaninglessness."

Don\'t waste your time and money on this book, as I sadly did.I\'m not a ""fantasy veteran"", but you don\'t need to be one to notice this book is the work of an amateur. Shame on the publisher for killing trees to print it.If you are considering reading this book, go and re-read Tolkien.To Christopher Paolini, you should read Tolkien too, so you can see how far you are from writing a good book."
2994,0,"Parental Control: I was amazed that such a young man could write so well. Then the story itself is thoughful and exciting for the younger generation. I enjoyed it just as I enjoy all the Harry Potter books. They are good reading. But to also learn his parents helped him publish it and sell it, is remarkable. Not too many parents like that any more. We could use a whole lot more for examples and we would then have more productive young people."
2995,0,"Hmmm: From reading the bestseller list on Amazon, one can come up with a number of conclusions: Everyone is fat, nobody knows anything about politics, and they wouldn't know a good book if it hit them in the face."

2997,0,"embarrassing indeed: Though I suppose that Mr Paolini is quite well off for the moment, somebody should get him down to earth and get him to know that things like that are no feat and that his readers (unless they do earnestly think that this bunk is ""innovative"") are bored to the bones."
